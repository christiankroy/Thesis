\abstract{} 

Analysis of gene expression has undergone a technical revolution. What was impossible 6 years ago is now routine. The application of high-throughput DNA sequencing machines capable of generating hundreds of millions of reads allows, indeed forces, a major revision in how we think about the genome's functional output\textendash the transcriptome.

\indent This thesis examines the history of DNA sequencing, the application of sequencing to the measurement of gene expression, and some of the more interesting features of transcripts, including Alternative Splicing and mammalian piRNA biogenesis. Examination of these topics is framed around development of a novel RNA-templated DNA:DNA ligation assay (SeqZip). SeqZip allows for a more efficient analysis of the abundant and function long RNA molecules present in the transcriptome.

\indent The thesis closes with a discussion on future applications of the SeqZip methodology, when major advancements in high-throughput sequencing are a certainty. Finally, challenges facing biomedical researches in the new climate of extremely large and rich datasets are discussed.
