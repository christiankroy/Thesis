First I would like to thank Laura Geagan and Rebecca Sendak, my supervisors while a research associate at Genzyme. Without the confidence they instilled in my abilities as a young researcher I doubt I would have ever signed up for more school.

During my 1st year retreat at Wood’s Hole I observed Melissa's fantastic ability as a communicator of interesting and important Science. She brought out her rope representing unspliced dystrophin---a rope that reached to the back of a rather large auditorium---and then dramatically held up a ``No.2'' pencil representing the final mRNA product. Both were to scale. I knew then that I wanted join her lab. Thanks Melissa for teaching me so much.

Soon after joining Melissa’s lab, with a project going well, it was proposed that I be a joint student between Melissa and Phil. It was not difficult to jump at the opportunity to be advised by \textit{two} Hughes Investigators. I have been continually amazed at the depth of Phil’s knowledge. He is a careful, meticulous, quantitative, and careful mentor. Phil forces me to think and act outside my comfort zone, something I always tell myself is essential for change and growth. Thank you Phil for everything I've learned.

My committee has also been very supportive throughput my PhD. I hardly believed the ease with which I passed my qualifying exam and figured there must have been some mistake. TRAC meetings confirmed that I was not thinking off-base. One-on-one meetings just prior to my QE were especially helpful. Thanks to Scot, Job, and Zhiping for all your guidance.

Thanks to all members of the Za(Moore) labs, past and present. Specifically I would like to thank other members of my year in the Moore Lab, Eric and Erin. Thanks to fantastic past post-docs Amrit, Alper, and Aaron. Also thanks again to Alper and to Bo and Can for my novice bioinformatic questions.

Thanks to the faculty I have interacted with throughout my time at Umass, including Dave Weaver, Brent Graveley, Andres Muro, Manuel Garber, and Heinrich Gottlinger. And thanks to Anna from the Gottlinger lab for involving me in her HIV and hUPF1 story.

My project was pushed forward by a pair of great rotation students: Ben Landry and Ogooluwa (``Ogo'') Adegoke Ojelabi . Thanks you two for letting me know SeqZip was robust beyond my own hands.

My family always instilled the importance and value of education. Thank you Mom, Dad, Grandpa and Grandma for sacrificing to provide me so much opportunity. I hope I have made you proud.

Finally, and most importantly, I would like to acknowledge the love and support of my wife, Julie. Much of my success can be attributed to her hard work and support over the last 15 years. Our son, Owen, is lucky to have such an amazing mom. Our family is truly blessed. Thanks P :)
