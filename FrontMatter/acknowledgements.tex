First I would like to acknowledge and thank Laura Geagan and Rebecca Sendak at Genzyme. They were my supervisors while I was a research associate there, and assisted and encouraged my transition back to graduate school. Without the confidence they instilled in my abilities as a young scientist in, I doubt I would have ever signed up for more school. 

Next I’d like to thank Melissa. During my 1st year retreat at Wood’s Hole I first learned that Melissa is a fantastic communicator of interesting and important science. When she brought out her rope representing the unspliced pre-mRNA of dystrophin—a rope that reached to the back of a rather large auditorium—and then dramatically held up a No.2 pencil representing the final mRNA product, both to scale, I knew the that I wanted to do my graduate research in her lab. I have never once doubted the decision to join Melissa’s lab, and have learned so much from the broad and interconnected approach she takes to important scientific questions. Thank you so much for teaching me to always consider the big picture, go for the answer, and to just ask when I need help.

Soon after joining Melissa’s lab, and a project going well, it was proposed to me that I be a joint student between Melissa and Phil. It was not difficult to not jump at the opportunity to be advised by two Howard Hughes Investigators, and I also haven’t regretted the decision. Over the past few years, I have been continually amazed at the depth of Phil’s knowledge, in scientific and general topics. He is a careful, meticulous, quantitative, and calculating mentor. While I feel that I clicked ‘on the level’ with Melissa, interacting with Phil forced me to think and act outside my comfort zone, something I always tell myself is a critical aspect of change and growth. Thank you Phil for everything I’ve learned.

My committee has also been very supportive throughput my PhD. I hardly believed the ease with which I passed my qualifying exam, and took it as a big confidence boost. The following years of TRAC meetings confirmed that I was not thinking way off-base. The one-on-one meetings just prior to my QE were especially helpful. Thanks to Scot, Job, and especially Zhiping for all the guidance.
