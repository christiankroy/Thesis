	%I would like to dedicate this Doctoral dissertation to my grandfather, George Knauf. My grandfather passed away on September 23rd, 2011, just one week shy of his 82nd birthday. I find it difficult to articulate how much I miss him. He spoke carefully and never without purpose or conviction. While I hear from others that he was proud of me, he rarely, if ever, betrayed that type of emotion directly. It is my goal to build as solid a life as he, founded on hard work, playing the long game, responsibility, and maintaining friendships. These are just a few of the personality traits that I observed and try to emulate. The fact that he passed before he could meet our son Owen is one of my biggest regrets. Of all the possessions he left behind, it is the memory of our time together that I will cherish the most. Rest in peace, Grump. I did it. 
  For the Grump\ldots I did it.
