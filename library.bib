Duplexes with terminal GC pairs are more stable than duplexes with the same nearest neighbors but terminal AU pairs. Penalizing terminal AU base pairs by 0.45 kcal/mol relative to terminal GC base pairs significantly improves predictions of ?G°37 from a nearest-neighbor model. A physical model is suggested in which the differential treatment of AU and GC ends accounts for the dependence of the total number of Watson?Crick hydrogen bonds on the base composition of a duplex. On average, the new parameters predict ?G°37, ?H°, ?S°, and TM within 3.2\%, 6.0\%, 6.8\%, and 1.3 °C, respectively.

They control embryonic gene expression by several means, ranging from microRNA-induced degradation of mRNAs to long ncRNA-mediated modification of chromatin. Many aspects of embryogenesis seem to be controlled by ncRNAs, including the maternal-zygotic transition, the maintenance of pluripotency, the patterning of the body axes, the specification and differentiation of cell types and the morphogenesis of organs. Drawing from several animal model systems, we describe two emerging themes for ncRNA function: promoting developmental transitions and maintaining developmental states. These examples also highlight the roles of ncRNAs in ensuring a robust commitment to one of two possible cell fates.},

abstract = {Recent advances in genome sequencing technologies provide unprecedented opportunities to characterize individual genomic landscapes and identify mutations relevant for diagnosis and therapy. Specifically, whole-exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is gaining popularity in the human genetics community due to the moderate costs, manageable data amounts and straightforward interpretation of analysis results. While whole-exome and, in the near future, whole-genome sequencing are becoming commodities, data analysis still poses significant challenges and led to the development of a plethora of tools supporting specific parts of the analysis workflow or providing a complete solution. Here, we surveyed 205 tools for whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data analysis supporting five distinct analytical steps: quality assessment, alignment, variant identification, variant annotation and visualization. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual tools. We then selected 32 programs for variant identification, variant annotation and visualization, which were subjected to hands-on evaluation using four data sets: one set of exome data from two patients with a rare disease for testing identification of germline mutations, two cancer data sets for testing variant callers for somatic mutations, copy number variations and structural variations, and one semi-synthetic data set for testing identification of copy number variations. Our comprehensive survey and evaluation of NGS tools provides a valuable guideline for human geneticists working on Mendelian disorders, complex diseases and cancers.},

abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly dynamic network of proteins, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. Numerous diseases result from mutation in genes coding for ECM proteins, but only recently it has been reported that mutations in the fibronectin (FN) gene were associated with a human disorder. FN is one of the main components of the ECM. It generates protein diversity through alternative splicing of a single pre-mRNA, having at least 20 different isoforms in humans. The precise function of these protein isoforms has remained obscure in most cases. Only in the recent few years, it was possible to shed light on the multiple roles of the alternatively spliced FN isoforms. This substantial progress was achieved basically with the knowledge derived from engineered mouse models bearing subtle mutations in specific FN domains. These data, together with a recent report associating mutations in the FN gene to a form of glomerulopathy, clearly show that mutations in constitutive exons or misregulation of alternatively spliced domains of the FN gene may have nonlethal pathological consequences. In this review, we focus on the pathological consequences of mutations in the FN gene, by connecting the function of alternatively spliced isoforms of fibronectin to human diseases.},

abstract = {1Istituto di Genetica Molecolare-Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche Via Abbiategrasso 207, 27100 Pavia, Italy 2Medical Research Council Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh EH4 2XU, UK In response to physical and chemical stresses that affect protein folding and, thus, the execution of normal metabolic processes, cells activate gene-expression strategies aimed at increasing their chance of survival. One target of several stressing agents is pre-mRNA splicing, which is inhibited upon heat shock. Recently, the molecular basis of this splicing inhibition has begun to emerge. Interestingly, different mechanisms seem to be in place to block constitutive pre-mRNA splicing and to affect alternative splicing regulation. This could be important to modulate gene expression during recovery from stress. Thus, pre-mRNA splicing emerges as a central mechanism to integrate cellular and metabolic stresses into gene-expression profiles.   Box 1. Spliceosome assembly During spliceosome assembly, the 5′ and 3′ splice sites are recognized by the U1 snRNP and the heterodimeric splicing factor U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF), respectively, to form the E complex. The U2 snRNP is then recruited by U2AF to the branch point, in an ATP-dependent manner, generating the A complex. The pre-catalytic B complex is formed by the recruitment of the U4–U6–U5 tri-snRNP to the pre-spliceosome. This is followed by a series of complex rearrangements that lead to the displacement of U1 and U4 snRNP [65]. Subsequent formation of the activated B* spliceosome promotes the first step of splicing that gives rise to the cleaved 5′ exon and intron–3′-exon lariat intermediates. Finally, the C complex catalyzes the second step of splicing, during which the intron is excised and the 5′ and 3′ exons are ligated to form mRNA [66] (Figure I). Owing to its broad impact on gene-expression programs, alternative splicing provides an ideal means to modulate gene expression to the needs of the cells in response to stressing conditions. This is even more evident if it is considered that alternative-splicing events are direct targets of signal-transduction cascades. Thus, impacting on specific signaling pathways could have drastic effects on splicing of specific pre-mRNAs, sometimes giving rise to protein isoforms with unique properties upon stress stimuli. For example, 5′ splice-site selection in the 5′ non-coding region of the HSP47 (heat-shock protein 47) pre-mRNA is affected by heat shock, giving rise to a splicing isoform that is translated more efficiently under heat-shock conditions [8]. Cold shock, but not heat shock or hyper-osmolarity, induces neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) pre-mRNA alternative splicing, which promotes the inclusion of a cryptic exon. Interestingly, this alternative-splicing event is not cell-type specific [9]. Alternative-spliced isoforms of MDM2 (murine double mutant 2), a negative regulator of p53, are induced upon genotoxic stress, resulting in p53 activation and triggering of the p53 damage response [10]. Finally, long-term neuronal hypersensitivity under stress is associated with stress-induced alternative splicing of neuronal acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) pre-mRNA [11]. This process has been linked with increased expression of the SR protein SC35, which promotes sustainable stress-induced alternative splicing of neuronal acetylcholinesterase mRNA [12]. Changes in splicing activity associated with stress are not exclusive to mammalian cells; indeed, recent work shows that the splicing of ribosomal protein-encoding genes is specifically inhibited in response to amino acid starvation in yeast [13]. Furthermore, stress-induced alternative splicing is of crucial importance for stress adaptation in plants (for review, see Ref. [14]). Here, we focus on the impact of cellular stress, most notably heat shock, on the gene-expression cascade. In particular, we highlight how stress stimuli block pre-mRNA splicing and affect the regulation of alternative splicing. We present a few possible mechanisms by which stress stimuli inhibit RNA splicing, but we do not focus on the many connections between alternative splicing and cancer, which have been covered in some recent reviews [15] and [16]. Stressing agents, such as heat shock, lead to an immediate block of every important metabolic process, including DNA replication, transcription, mRNA export and translation, until the cells recover. Heat-shock proteins (HSPs), which are induced by heat-shock transcription factors (HSFs), protect cells from injury and facilitate recovery and survival after a return to normal growth conditions (for review, see Ref. [17] and [18]) (Box 2). One of the best characterized changes in the response to stress is the shutdown of pre-mRNA splicing observed in heat-shocked cells [19], [20] and [21]. Importantly, this change does not affect the expression of HSP genes because most do not contain introns. Intriguingly, however, introns in HSP90a, HSP90b and HSP27 gene transcripts are properly spliced in heat-shocked human cells indicating that the block of splicing is not complete [22]. Many experiments have taken advantage of the fact that the inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing can be recapitulated in extracts from heat-shocked cells [20] and [23] and have shown that the splicing block after heat shock is caused by the inactivation of an activity termed HSLF (heat-shock labile splicing factor), which functions in the assembly of the U4–U6–U5 tri-snRNP [21]. However, it should be pointed out that despite the robust block in splicing of the few transcripts tested, the true extent of splicing inhibition upon heat shock has not been studied using global approaches. Therefore, it is not entirely clear whether the heat-shock-induced block in pre-mRNA splicing affects the majority of pre-mRNAs, whether all transcripts are affected to a similar degree, or whether heat shock targets only specific subsets of pre-mRNAs. Box 2. Cellular stress Stressing factors include various environmental (e.g. heat, cold, UV-light, oxygen, ion balance and heavy metals) and pathological factors (e.g. infections, inflammation, fever and ischemia). The cellular response depends on the nature and the intensity of the stressing condition. Some stressing agents directly challenge the integrity of the genome (genotoxic stress) by generating different types of DNA damage or perturbing the DNA replication process. Other agents cause protein denaturation, lipid peroxidation or a disturbance in the cellular redox state. The intensity of stress is also an important determinant for the type of response mounted by the cells; severe stresses are cytotoxic and can cause permanent growth arrest or cell death either by apoptosis or necrosis [67]. The best characterized stress-defense mechanism, which is triggered by a variety of stressing conditions, involves the transcriptional activation of a set of genes encoding molecular chaperones and those, for historical reasons, are called heat-shock genes. In vertebrate cells, heat-shock genes are under the control of a family of transcription factors: the so-called heat-shock factors, HSF1 to HSF4 [68]. Among them, only HSF1 is crucial for the activation of heat-shock genes after thermal stress. HSF1 is maintained in an inactive form in the cytoplasm. Its activation upon heat shock requires several events that ultimately lead to HSF1 trimerization and nuclear import, in which this transcription factor binds the heat-shock element in the promoters of heat-inducible genes [69]. In addition to the heat-shock response, other defense mechanisms are activated in a stress-specific manner. For example, the oxidative defense mechanism encompasses both enzymatic (superoxide dismutase, peroxidases and catalases) and non-enzymatic (glutathione and thioredoxin) detoxification mechanisms that destroy reactive oxygen species or restore the cellular redox balance [70] and [71]. The cellular defense against cadmium and heavy metals entails the synthesis of protective molecules such as metallothioneins and glutathione [72]. DNA-damaging agents (such as UV irradiation) trigger p53 and DNA-checkpoint-pathway activation. Finally, the cellular response to increased osmolarity can be divided in to immediate and delayed phases. The immediate response takes place within seconds and involves an increase in the intracellular concentration of charged ions such as potassium, sodium and chloride that are mediated by pre-existing ion transport systems [73]. The delayed or adaptive response, by contrast, is a slow process; it occurs over a period of hours and requires the activation of genes that enable ionic osmolytes to be replaced with non-ionic ones. The activation of these genes depends on the activity of transcription factor TonEBP (tonicity enhancer binding protein) [74]. SRp38 is an SR protein family member with a single N-terminal RRM followed by a C-terminal RS domain that displays unique properties [24] and [25]. It was originally identified independently as a neuron-specific SR protein, NSSR-1 [26], and also in a two-hybrid screen using the human translocation liposarcoma (TLS) gene as bait [27]. When overexpressed in human cells it antagonizes the activity of classical SR proteins SF2/ASF (splicing factor 2; also known as alternative splicing factor) and SC35, and activates the more distal 5′ splice sites of the adenoviral E1A gene [24]. In vitro studies showed that, in contrast to classical SR proteins, phosphorylated SRp38 functions as a sequence-specific activator of splicing and that its activity requires the presence of an as yet unidentified cofactor. This unique activity stems from the ability of SRp38 to enter a ternary complex with U1 snRNP and pre-mRNA that strengthens the interaction of U1 and U2 snRNP with the pre-mRNA. However, in the absence of this cofactor, SRp38 promotes the formation of splicing complex A, but canno},

abstract = {Alternative polyadenylation (APA) of mRNAs has emerged as an important mechanism for post-transcriptional gene regulation in higher eukaryotes. Although microarrays have recently been used to characterize APA globally, they have a number of serious limitations that prevents comprehensive and highly quantitative analysis. To better characterize APA and its regulation, we have developed a deep sequencing-based method called Poly(A) Site Sequencing (PAS-Seq) for quantitatively profiling RNA polyadenylation at the transcriptome level. PAS-Seq not only accurately and comprehensively identifies poly(A) junctions in mRNAs and noncoding RNAs, but also provides quantitative information on the relative abundance of polyadenylated RNAs. PAS-Seq analyses of human and mouse transcriptomes showed that 40\%–50\% of all expressed genes produce alternatively polyadenylated mRNAs. Furthermore, our study detected evolutionarily conserved polyadenylation of histone mRNAs and revealed novel features of mitochondrial RNA polyadenylation. Finally, PAS-Seq analyses of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, neural stem/progenitor (NSP) cells, and neurons not only identified more poly(A) sites than what was found in the entire mouse EST database, but also detected significant changes in the global APA profile that lead to lengthening of 3′ untranslated regions (UTR) in many mRNAs during stem cell differentiation. Together, our PAS-Seq analyses revealed a complex landscape of RNA polyadenylation in mammalian cells and the dynamic regulation of APA during stem cell differentiation.},

abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful tool for transcriptome profiling, but is hampered by sequence-dependent bias and inaccuracy at low copy numbers intrinsic to exponential PCR amplification. We developed a simple strategy for mitigating these complications, allowing truly digital RNA-Seq. Following reverse transcription, a large set of barcode sequences is added in excess, and nearly every cDNA molecule is uniquely labeled by random attachment of barcode sequences to both ends. After PCR, we applied paired-end deep sequencing to read the two barcodes and cDNA sequences. Rather than counting the number of reads, RNA abundance is measured based on the number of unique barcode sequences observed for a given cDNA sequence. We optimized the barcodes to be unambiguously identifiable, even in the presence of multiple sequencing errors. This method allows counting with single-copy resolution despite sequence-dependent bias and PCR-amplification noise, and is analogous to digital PCR but amendable to quantifying a whole transcriptome. We demonstrated transcriptome profiling of Escherichia coli with more accurate and reproducible quantification than conventional RNA-Seq.},

The accessibilities of siRNA and target mRNA for hybridization, as measured by folding free energy change, are shown to be significantly correlated with efficacy. For this study, a partition function calculation that considers all possible secondary structures is used to predict target site accessibility; a significant improvement over calculations that consider only the predicted lowest free energy structure or a set of low free energy structures. The predicted thermodynamic features, in addition to siRNA sequence features, are used as input for a support vector machine that selects functional siRNA. The method works well for predicting efficient siRNA (efficacy >70\%) in a large siRNA data set from Novartis. The positive predictive value (percentage of sites predicted to be efficient for silencing that are) is as high as 87.6\%. The sensitivity and specificity are 22.7 and 96.5\%, respectively. When tested on data from different sources, the positive predictive value increased 8.1\% by adding equilibrium terms to 25 local sequence features. Prediction of hybridization affinity using partition functions is now available in the RNAstructure software package.},

We found a conserved increase in expression of mRNAs terminating at upstream polyadenylation sites after activation of primary murine CD4+ T lymphocytes. This program, resulting in shorter 3'UTRs, is a characteristic of gene expression during immune cell activation and correlates with proliferation across diverse cell types and tissues. Forced expression of full-length 3'UTRs conferred reduced protein expression. In some cases the reduction in protein expression could be reversed by deletion of predicted microRNA target sites in the variably included region. Our data indicate that gene expression is coordinately regulated, such that states of increased proliferation are associated with widespread reductions in the 3'UTR-based regulatory capacity of mRNAs.},

abstract = {A family of highly polymorphic neuronal cell surface proteins, the neurexins, has been identified. At least two genes for neurexins exist. Each gene uses alternative promoters and multiple variably spliced exons to potentially generate more than a 100 different neurexin transcripts. The neurexins were discovered by the identification of one member of the family as the receptor for alpha-latrotoxin. This toxin is a component of the venom from black widow spiders; it binds to presynaptic nerve terminals and triggers massive neurotransmitter release. Neurexins contain single transmembrane regions and extracellular domains with repeated sequences similar to sequences in laminin A, slit, and agrin, proteins that have been implicated in axon guidance and synaptogenesis. An antibody to neurexin I showed highly concentrated immunoreactivity at the synapse. The polymorphic structure of the neurexins, their neural localization, and their sequence similarity to proteins associated with neurogenesis suggest a function as cell recognition molecules in the nerve terminal.},

In animals, the Argonaute superfamily segregates into two clades. The Argonaute clade acts in RNAi and in microRNA-mediated gene regulation in partnership with 21-22 nt RNAs. The Piwi clade, and their 26-30 nt piRNA partners, have yet to be assigned definitive functions. In mice, two Piwi-family members have been demonstrated to have essential roles in spermatogenesis. Here, we examine the effects of disrupting the gene encoding the third family member, MIWI2. Miwi2-deficient mice display a meiotic-progression defect in early prophase of meiosis I and a marked and progressive loss of germ cells with age. These phenotypes may be linked to an inappropriate activation of transposable elements detected in Miwi2 mutants. Our observations suggest a conserved function for Piwi-clade proteins in the control of transposons in the germline.</p>},

abstract = {Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs generated by a conserved pathway. Their most widely studied function involves restricting transposable elements, particularly in the germline, where piRNAs are highly abundant. Increasingly, another set of piRNAs derived from intergenic regions appears to have a role in the regulation of mRNA from early embryos and gonads. We report a more widespread expression of a limited set of piRNAs and particularly focus on their expression in the hippocampus. Deep sequencing of extracted RNA from the mouse hippocampus revealed a set of small RNAs in the size range of piRNAs. These were confirmed by their presence in the piRNA database as well as coimmunoprecipitation with MIWI. Their expression was validated by Northern blot and in situ hybridization in cultured hippocampal neurons, where signal from one piRNA extended to the dendritic compartment. Antisense suppression of this piRNA suggested a role in spine morphogenesis. Possible targets include genes, which control spine shape by a distinctive mechanism in comparison to microRNAs.},

We compared RNA sequences from human B cells of 27 individuals to the corresponding DNA sequences from the same individuals and uncovered more than 10,000 exonic sites where the RNA sequences do not match that of the DNA. All 12 possible categories of discordances were observed. These differences were nonrandom as many sites were found in multiple individuals and in different cell types, including primary skin cells and brain tissues. Using mass spectrometry, we detected peptides that are translated from the discordant RNA sequences and thus do not correspond exactly to the DNA sequences. These widespread RNA-DNA differences in the human transcriptome provide a yet unexplored aspect of genome variation.},

abstract = {In mammals a considerable 92\% of genes contain introns, with hundreds and hundreds of these introns reaching the incredible size of over 50,000 nucleotides. These "large introns" must be spliced out of the pre-mRNA in a timely fashion, which involves bringing together distant 5' and 3' acceptor and donor splice sites. In invertebrates, especially Drosophila, it has been shown that larger introns can be spliced efficiently through a process known as recursive splicing-a consecutive splicing from the 5'-end at a series of combined donor-acceptor splice sites called RP-sites. Using a computational analysis of the genomic sequences, we show that vertebrates lack the proper enrichment of RP-sites in their large introns, and, therefore, require some other method to aid splicing. We analyzed over 15,000 non-redundant, large introns from six mammals, 1,600 from chicken and zebrafish, and 560 non-redundant large introns from five invertebrates. Our bioinformatic investigation demonstrates that, unlike the studied invertebrates, the studied vertebrate genomes contain consistently abundant amounts of direct and complementary strand interspersed repetitive elements (mainly SINEs and LINEs) that may form stems with each other in large introns. This examination showed that predicted stems are indeed abundant and stable in the large introns of mammals. We hypothesize that such stems with long loops within large introns allow intron splice sites to find each other more quickly by folding the intronic RNA upon itself at smaller intervals and, thus, reducing the distance between donor and acceptor sites.},

abstract = {Epigenetic changes are involved in a wide range of common human diseases. Although DNA methylation defects are known to be associated with male infertility in mice, their impact on human deficiency of sperm production has yet to be determined. We have assessed the global genomic DNA methylation profiles in human infertile male patients with spermatogenic disorders by using the Infinium Human Methylation27 BeadChip. Three populations were studied: conserved spermatogenesis, spermatogenic failure due to germ cell maturation defects, and Sertoli cell-only syndrome samples. A disease-associated DNA methylation profile, characterized by targeting members of the PIWI-associated RNA (piRNA) processing machinery, was obtained. Bisulfite genomic sequencing and pyrosequencing in a large cohort (n = 46) of samples validated the altered DNA methylation patterns observed in piRNA-processing genes. In particular, male infertility was associated with the promoter hypermethylation-associated silencing of PIWIL2 and TDRD1. The downstream effects mediated by the epigenetic inactivation of the PIWI pathway genes were a defective production of piRNAs and a hypomethylation of the LINE-1 repetitive sequence in the affected patients. Overall, our data suggest that DNA methylation, at least that affecting PIWIL2/TDRD1, has a role in the control of gene expression in spermatogenesis and its imbalance contributes to an unsuccessful germ cell development that might explain a group of male infertility disorders.},

In mammals, two main Polycomb group complexes exist - Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and 2 (PRC2). PRC1 compacts chromatin and catalyses the monoubiquitylation of histone H2A. PRC2 also contributes to chromatin compaction, and catalyses the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. PRC2 is involved in various biological processes, including differentiation, maintaining cell identity and proliferation, and stem-cell plasticity. Recent studies of PRC2 have expanded our perspectives on its function and regulation, and uncovered a role for non-coding RNA in the recruitment of PRC2 to target genes.},

The map identified a large cohort of specific FOX2 targets, many of which are themselves splicing regulators, and comparison between the FOX2 binding profile and validated splicing events revealed a general rule for FOX2-regulated exon inclusion or skipping in a position-dependent manner. These findings suggest that FOX2 functions as a critical regulator of a splicing network, and we further show that FOX2 is important for the survival of human embryonic stem cells.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing regulation not only depends on the interaction of splicing factors with splicing enhancers and silencers in the pre-mRNA, but also on the coupling between transcription and splicing. This coupling is possible because splicing is often cotranscriptional and promoter identity and occupation may affect alternative splicing. We discuss here the different mechanisms by which transcription regulates alternative splicing. These include the recruitment of splicing factors to the transcribing polymerase and "kinetic coupling", which involves changes in the rate of transcriptional elongation that in turn affect the timing in which splice sites are presented to the splicing machinery. The recruitment mechanism may depend on the particular features of the carboxyl terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, whereas kinetic coupling seems to be linked to how changes in chromatin structure and other factors affect transcription elongation.},

abstract = {The role of alternative splicing (AS) in eliciting immune responses is poorly understood. We used quantitative AS microarray profiling to survey changes in AS during activation of Jurkat cells, a leukemia-derived T-cell line. Our results indicate that approximately 10-15\% of the profiled alternative exons undergo a >10\% change in inclusion level during activation. The majority of the genes displaying differential AS levels are distinct from the set of genes displaying differential transcript levels. These two gene sets also have overlapping yet distinct functional roles. For example, genes that show differential AS patterns during T-cell activation are often closely associated with cell-cycle regulation, whereas genes with differential transcript levels are highly enriched in functions associated more directly with immune defense and cytoskeletal architecture. Previously unknown AS events were detected in genes that have important roles in T-cell activation, and these AS level changes were also observed during the activation of normal human peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. In summary, by using AS microarray profiling, we have discovered many new AS changes associated with T-cell activation. Our results suggest an extensive role for AS in the regulation of the mammalian immune response.},

Incorporation of mRNA fragment length distribution in paired-end RNA-seq greatly improved estimation of alternative-splicing levels. MISO also detects differentially regulated exons or isoforms. Application of MISO implicated the RNA splicing factor hnRNP H1 in the regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation, a role that was supported by UV cross-linking–immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) analysis in human cells. Our results provide a probabilistic framework for RNA-seq analysis, give functional insights into pre-mRNA processing and yield guidelines for the optimal design of RNA-seq experiments for studies of gene and isoform expression.},

abstract = {The pathway of gene expression in higher eukaryotes involves a highly complex network of physical and functional interactions among the different machines involved in each step of the pathway. Here we established an efficient in vitro system to determine how RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription is functionally coupled to pre-mRNA splicing. Strikingly, our data show that nascent pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) synthesized by RNAP II is immediately and quantitatively directed into the spliceosome assembly pathway. In contrast, nascent pre-mRNA synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase is quantitatively assembled into the nonspecific H complex, which consists of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) proteins and is inhibitory for spliceosome assembly. Consequently, RNAP II transcription results in a dramatic increase in both the kinetics of splicing and overall yield of spliced mRNA relative to that observed for T7 transcription. We conclude that RNAP II mediates the functional coupling of transcription to splicing by directing the nascent pre-mRNA into spliceosome assembly, thereby bypassing interaction of the pre-mRNA with the inhibitory hnRNP proteins.},

@article{Oh1999,
abstract = {The myb gene family consists of three members, named A, B and c-myb which encode nuclear proteins that function as transcriptional transactivators. Proteins encoded by these three genes exhibit a tripartate structure with an N-terminal DNA-binding domain, a central transactivation domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain. These proteins exhibit highest homology in their DNA binding domains and appear to bind DNA with overlapping sequence specificities. Transactivation by myb gene family varies considerably depending on cell type and promoter context suggesting a dependence on interaction with other cell type specific co-factors. While the C-terminal domains of A-Myb and c-Myb proteins exert a negative regulatory effect on their transcriptional transactivation function, the C-terminal domain of B-Myb appears to function as a positive regulator of this activity. One or more of these proteins interact with other transcription factors such as Ets-2, CEBP and NF-M. In addition, expression of these genes is cell cycle-regulated and inhibition of their expression with antisense oligonucleotides has been found to affect cell cycle-progression, cell division and/or differentiation. Members of the myb gene family exhibit different temporal and spatial expression patterns suggesting a distinctive function for each of these genes. Gene knockout experiments show that these genes play an essential role in development. Loss of c-myb function results in embryonic lethality due to failure of fetal hepatic hematopoiesis. A-myb null mutant mice, on the other hand are viable but exhibit growth abnormalities, and defects in spermatogenesis and female breast development. While the role of c-myb in oncogenesis is well established, future experiments are likely to provide further clues regarding the role of A-myb and B-myb in tumorigenesis.},

Best Institute, University of Toronto, 112 College Street, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1L6, Canada We describe the application of a microarray platform, which combines information from exon body and splice-junction probes, to perform a quantitative analysis of tissue-specific alternative splicing (AS) for thousands of exons in mammalian cells. Through this system, we have analyzed global features of AS in major mouse tissues. The results provide numerous inferences for the functions of tissue-specific AS, insights into how the evolutionary history of exons can impact on their inclusion levels, and also information on how global regulatory properties of AS define tissue type. Like global transcription profiles, global AS profiles reflect tissue identity. Interestingly, we find that transcription and AS act independently on different sets of genes in order to define tissue-specific expression profiles. These results demonstrate the utility of our quantitative microarray platform and data for revealing important global regulatory features of AS.   Alternative splicing is known to play numerous critical roles in regulatory pathways in metazoans, including those controlling cell growth, cell death, differentiation and development, and its misregulation has been implicated in many life-threatening human diseases (Blencowe 2000), (Caceres and Kornblihtt 2002), (Cartegni et al. 2002), (Faustino and Cooper 2003) and (Smith and Valcarcel 2000). A major goal of the postgenomic era is to identify physiologically- and disease-relevant AS events to determine where and when these occur, what their specific roles are, and how they are regulated. In contrast to the considerable advances made in recent years in the understanding of global regulatory properties of transcription, very little is understood as to how AS events are globally regulated and coordinated under different conditions. These fundamental questions require advances in the development of high-throughput technologies for monitoring alternative splicing. To date, most efforts in this direction have focused on computational analyses of AS using complementary DNA (cDNA) and expressed sequence tag (EST) data, and efforts to harness microarray technology for analyzing AS have begun. Computational approaches with cDNA and EST data have allowed inferences to be made regarding the location, frequency, and conservation of AS events in different organisms (Brett et al. 2002), (Modrek and Lee 2003), (Nurtdinov et al. 2003), (Pan et al. 2005), (Sorek et al. 2004), (Thanaraj et al. 2003) and (Xu et al. 2002). A limitation of these approaches is that AS can be detected only in transcripts for which there is sufficient sequence coverage. Moreover, the available sequences often are represented for only a limited number of cell and tissue types, which, in the case of human and mouse ESTs, are frequently derived from tumor or cell-line sources. Consequently, it is not possible to obtain substantial information on cell or tissue-type specific inclusion levels of alternative exons by using sequence-based computational approaches. Recently, a number of groups have begun to explore the use of different experimental approaches for the high-throughput detection and monitoring of RNA processing events (Lee and Roy, 2004). Spotted-oligonucleotide microarrays employing probes designed to detect unprocessed and processed RNA have been used to monitor pre-mRNA splicing in yeast (Clark et al., 2002) and the processing of noncoding RNAs in yeast and mammals (Peng et al. 2003) and (Babak et al. 2004). A fiber optic-based array method (Yeakley et al., 2002), a polymerase colony assay (Zhu et al., 2003), and more conventional microarray-based approaches utilizing spotted cDNA fragments or oligonucleotides (Hu et al. 2001), (Johnson et al. 2003) and (Wang et al. 2003) have been used for monitoring AS in mammalian cells. The most extensive use of the latter approach was the application of “exon-junction” microarrays for the discovery of exon skipping events in human tissues and cell lines (Johnson et al., 2003). These authors used custom microarrays containing oligonucleotide probes complementary to mapped exon-exon junction sequences in RefSeq genes for the main purpose of discovering new AS events in human transcripts. Despite the progress described above, a system has not yet been described that permits the large-scale quantitative profiling of alternative splicing in mammalian cell and tissue sources. This is primarily due to limitations stemming from the design of existing microarrays and the lack of suitable algorithms for data analysis. In this paper, we describe a microarray platform that permits the simultaneous quantification of the levels of thousands of alternative exons in mammalian cell and tissues sources. We have applied this system to the analysis of the regulation of 3126 sequence-verified AS events in diverse mouse tissues. The resulting data have generated hundreds of new inferences for functional roles of tissue-specific AS, insights into how the evolutionary origins of alternative exons relate to their inclusion levels in normal tissues, and information on global features of AS that underlie tissue-type specificity. This study therefore demonstrates the utility of a quantitative microarray platform for generating fundamental new insights into the global regulation of alternative splicing in mammals. In order to perform large-scale quantitative analyses of functionally diverse AS events in mammalian tissues, we developed a custom microarray to represent sequence-validated AS events mined from mouse cDNA and EST sequence databases (refer to Experimental Procedures). To minimize representation of possible splicing errors or relatively low-abundance transcripts, we selected “cassette-type” AS events with the highest numbers of supporting cDNA and EST sequences from different cell and tissue sources. To enhance the sensitivity of detection and quantification of inclusion/exclusion levels of alternative exons, each AS event was measured by using six different oligonucleotide probes: one body probe for each exon sequence, designated as “C1, A and C2” probes (C, constitutive; A, alternative), and one junction probe for each of the three splice-junction sequences generated by AS, designated as “C1-A, A-C2 and C1-C2” probes (Figure 1A). In addition, a control probe specific to each intron sequence (located between C1 and A) was included to permit detection of unspliced pre-mRNA and/or contaminating genomic DNA in the hybridizations. From an initial starting set of 4892 AS events in our database, 3126 AS events were selected for monitoring on a single ink-jet printed microarray, manufactured by Agilent Technologies (Figure 1B). The vast majority of the AS events correspond to cassette-type alternative exons, and additional events may correspond to mutually exclusive alternative exons. The 3126 AS events are represented by 2647 distinct genes, with 413 of the genes containing two or more AS events. In addition, 54 of the AS events represented on the microarray are duplicates and were monitored by sets of probes that in some cases are complementary to different sequences within the same exons. These served as reproducibility controls (see below). The 2647 AS genes represented on the microarray are associated with 1118 distinct Gene Ontology Biological Process (GO-BP) categories among a total set of 2362 GO-BP categories assigned to 10,361 Mouse Gene Informatics (MGI) markers (refer to Experimental Procedures; see below). This indicates that the AS genes represented on the microarray are associated with a diverse range of biological functions in mammalian cells. In order to assess the performance of our microarray system and to reveal global properties of alternative splicing in mammalian tissues, we hybridized random-primed Cy3/Cy5-labeled cDNA prepared from poly-A+ mRNA isolated from the following ten adult mouse tissues: brain, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, salivary, spleen, and testis. The poly-A+ RNA was isolated from tissue samples pooled from several animals (CD1 strain) in order to collect sufficient quantities and to reduce detection of possible animal-to-animal variability. Fluor-reversals were performed for each hybridization to control for signal reproducibility and label incorporation biases. A multistep data-processing procedure was employed to normalize probe signals between the separately hybridized arrays and to remove spatial-bias artifacts (refer to Experimental Procedures). Because each microarray probe has unique hybridization characteristics and the probe signals can depend on various parameters including transcript abundance, tissue source, and noise, a direct analysis of the normalized probe signals (i.e., taking ratios) was not sufficient for producing accurate measurements of alternative splicing levels (data not shown). We therefore developed a new data analysis tool, referred to as the generative model for the alternative splicing array platform (GenASAP), to automatically generate the percent alternatively spliced exon exclusion (\%ASex) values from the microarray data. This new tool, which employs machine learning and a Bayesian network, takes into account probe noise, outlier processes, abundance of transcript, and unanticipated correlations between probe values. In addition to outputting \%ASex values for each AS event, GenASAP outputs a number indicating the confidence level of the \%ASex value. These values were used to rank the 31},

>This study (1) investigates the effect of different genome annotations on RNA-seq quantification and (2) provides guidelines for choosing a genome annotation based on research focus.

        
>In the mapping stage, the least complex genome annotation, RefSeq Genes, appears to have the highest percentage of uniquely mapped short sequence reads. In the quantification stage, RefSeq Genes results in the most stable expression estimates in terms of the average coefficient of variation over all genes. Stable expression estimates in the quantification stage translate to accurate statistics for detecting differentially expressed genes. We observe that RefSeq Genes produces the most accurate fold-change measures with respect to a ground truth of RT-qPCR gene expression estimates.

        
>However, simpler genome annotations may limit opportunities for identifying or characterizing novel transcriptional or regulatory mechanisms. When conducting research that aims to be more exploratory, a more complex genome annotation may be preferred.

        
\#\#\# And the *take home*:

        
>Thus, when comparing RNA-seq fold-change statistics to ground truth RT-qPCR fold-change statis- tics, more complex annotations tend to have larger deviation and smaller correlation. In summary, the impact of genome annotation choice on RNA-seq expression estimates is significant, and the choice of annotation should depend on the study. Less complex genome annotations are preferable for studies that requiremorestableRNA-seq expressionestimates. However, to discover and explain unknown biological mechanisms, more comprehensive and complex genome annotations are necessary.

abstract = {The SWI/SNF (mating-type switch/sucrose nonfermenting) complex involved in chromatin remodeling on promoters has also been detected on the coding region of genes. Here we show that SWI/SNF can function as a regulator of alternative splicing. We found that the catalytic subunit Brm favors inclusion of variant exons in the mRNA of several genes, including E-cadherin, BIM, cyclin D1 and CD44. Consistent with this, Brm associates with several components of the spliceosome and with Sam68, an ERK-activated enhancer of variant exon inclusion. Examination of the CD44 gene revealed that Brm induced accumulation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with a modified CTD phosphorylation pattern on regions encoding variant exons. Altogether, our data suggest that on genes regulated by SWI/SNF, Brm contributes to the crosstalk between transcription and RNA processing by decreasing RNAPII elongation rate and facilitating recruitment of the splicing machinery to variant exons with suboptimal splice sites.},

abstract = {The paired-end ditagging (PET) technique has been shown to be efficient and accurate for large-scale transcriptome and genome analysis. However, as with other DNA tag-based sequencing strategies, it is constrained by the current efficiency of Sanger technology. A recently developed multiplex sequencing method (454-sequencing) using picolitre-scale reactions has achieved a remarkable advance in efficiency, but suffers from short-read lengths, and a lack of paired-end information. To further enhance the efficiency of PET analysis and at the same time overcome the drawbacks of the new sequencing method, we coupled multiplex sequencing with paired-end ditagging (MS-PET) using modified PET procedures to simultaneously sequence 200,000 to 300,000 dimerized PET (diPET) templates, with an output of nearly half-a-million PET sequences in a single 4 h machine run. We demonstrate the utility and robustness of MS-PET by analyzing the transcriptome of human breast carcinoma cells, and by mapping p53 binding sites in the genome of human colorectal carcinoma cells. This combined sequencing strategy achieved an approximate 100-fold efficiency increase over the current standard for PET analysis, and furthermore enables the short-read-length multiplex sequencing procedure to acquire paired-end information from large DNA fragments.},

To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the physiology and pathology of the brain, it becomes essential to understand the mechanisms that regulate the epigenome and transcriptome in neurons. Here, we review recent advances in the study of regulated neuronal gene expression, which are dramatically expanding as a result of the development of new and powerful contemporary methodologies, based on next-generation sequencing. This flood of new information has already transformed our understanding of many biological processes and is now driving discoveries elucidating the molecular mechanisms of brain function in cognition, behavior, and disease and may also inform the study of neuronal identity, diversity, and neuronal reprogramming.},

Exportin-t binds tRNA directly and with high affinity. Its cellular concentration in Xenopus oocytes was found to be rate-limiting for export of all tRNAs tested, as judged by microinjection experiments. RanGTP regulates the substrate-exportin-t interaction such that tRNA can be preferentially bound in the nucleus and released in the cytoplasm.},

@article{Modrich1973,
abstract = {The DNA-joining reaction catalyzed by the Escherichia coli DNA ligase is markedly enhanced by low concentrations of monovalent cations, NH4+ being most effective. The Km for NH4+ is about 1 mm, and at saturating concentrations it increases the true Vmax by 20-fold. Under these conditions the Km for diphosphopyridine nucleotide is 7 µm, the Km for single strand breaks is 0.03 to 0.06 µm, and the turnover number is 25 sealing events per min. The DNA-joining reaction obeys ping-pong kinetics, thus providing kinetic evidence for the participation of a covalent intermediate, presumably ligase-adenylate. The rate of the ligase-catalyzed diphosphopyridine nucleotide-nicotinamide mononucleotide exchange reaction is unaffected by NH4+, indicating that the activation occurs at a step subsequent to the formation of ligase-adenylate; furthermore, the exchange reaction is faster than the rate of DNA-joining, demonstrating that ligase-adenylate can be formed at a rate sufficient to be an intermediate in the over-all reaction. The rate of release of adenosine 5'-monophosphate from synthetic DNA-adenylate in the absence of NH4+ is greater than the rate of DNA-joining, as expected for a kinetically significant intermediate. However, in the presence of NH4+, the rate of adenosine 5'-monophosphate release is less than that of the over-all reaction. Since NH4+ markedly increases the apparent rate of dissociation of ligase-adenylate from DNA, the result may reflect reversal of the reaction to form ligaseadenylate from ligase and DNA-adenylate and dissociation of this form of the enzyme from the DNA.},

MILI (mouse Piwi-like), one of the three mouse PIWI family members, is indispensable for piRNA production, DNA methylation of retrotransposons presumably through the piRNA, and spermatogenesis. The biogenesis of piRNA has been divided into primary and secondary processing pathways; in both of these MILI is involved in mice. To analyze the molecular function of MILI in piRNA biogenesis, we utilized germline stem (GS) cells, which are derived from testicular stem cells and possess a spermatogonial phenotype. We established MILI-null GS cell lines and their revertant, MILI-rescued GS cells, by introducing the Mili gene with Sendai virus vector. Comparison of wild-type, MILI-null, and MILI-rescued GS cells revealed that GS cells were quite useful for analyzing the molecular mechanisms of piRNA production, especially the primary processing pathway. We found that glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 2 (GPAT2), a mitochondrial outer membrane protein for lysophosphatidic acid, bound to MILI using the cells and that gene knockdown of GPAT2 brought about impaired piRNA production in GS cells. GPAT2 is not only one of the MILI bound proteins but also a protein essential for primary piRNA biogenesis.},

abstract = {The Drosophila melanogaster gene Dscam (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) can generate thousands of different ectodomains via mutual exclusive splicing of three large exon clusters. The isoform diversity plays a profound role in both neuronal wiring and pathogen recognition. However, the isoform expression pattern at the global level remained unexplored. Here, we developed a novel method that allows for direct quantification of the alternatively spliced exon combinations from over hundreds of millions of Dscam transcripts in one sequencing run. With unprecedented sequencing depth, we detected a total of 18,496 isoforms, out of 19,008 theoretically possible combinations. Importantly, we demonstrated that alternative splicing between different clusters is independent. Moreover, the isoforms were expressed across a broad dynamic range, with significant bias in cell/tissue and developmental stage-specific patterns. Hitherto underappreciated, such bias can dramatically reduce the ability of neurons to display unique surface receptor codes. Therefore, the seemingly excessive diversity encoded in the Dscam locus might nevertheless be essential for a robust self and non-self discrimination in neurons.},

In this paper, we use pyrosequencing, a novel DNA sequencing technique, to reconstruct viral populations. Pyrosequencing produces DNA sequences, called reads, in numbers much greater than standard DNA sequencing techniques. However, these reads are substantially shorter and more error-prone than those obtained from standard sequencing techniques. Therefore, pyrosequencing data requires new methods of analysis. Here, we develop mathematical and statistical tools for reconstructing viral populations using pyrosequencing. To this end, we show how to correct errors in the reads and assemble them into the different viral strains present in the population. We apply these methods to HIV-1 populations from drug-resistant patients and show that our techniques produce results quite close to accepted techniques at a lower cost and potentially higher resolution.},

abstract = {Spermiogenesis is a long process whereby haploid spermatids derived from the meiotic divisions of spermatocytes undergo metamorphosis into spermatozoa. It is subdivided into distinct steps with 19 being identified in rats, 16 in mouse and 8 in humans. Spermiogenesis extends over 22.7 days in rats and 21.6 days in humans. In this part, we review several key events that take place during the development of spermatids from a structural and functional point of view. During early spermiogenesis, the Golgi apparatus forms the acrosome, a lysosome-like membrane bound organelle involved in fertilization. The endoplasmic reticulum undergoes several topographical and structural modifications including the formation of the radial body and annulate lamellae. The chromatoid body is fully developed and undergoes structural and functional modifications at this time. It is suspected to be involved in RNA storing and processing. The shape of the spermatid head undergoes extensive structural changes that are species-specific, and the nuclear chromatin becomes compacted to accommodate the stream-lined appearance of the sperm head. Microtubules become organized to form a curtain or manchette that associates with spermatids at specific steps of their development. It is involved in maintenance of the sperm head shape and trafficking of proteins in the spermatid cytoplasm. During spermiogenesis, many genes/proteins have been implicated in the diverse dynamic events occurring at this time of development of germ cells and the absence of some of these have been shown to result in subfertility or infertility.

abstract = {Much of the complex process of RNP biogenesis takes place at the gene cotranscriptionally. The target for RNA binding and processing factors is, therefore, not a solitary RNA molecule but, rather, a transcription elongation complex (TEC) comprising the growing nascent RNA and RNA polymerase traversing a chromatin template with associated passenger proteins. RNA maturation factors are not the only nuclear machines whose work is organized cotranscriptionally around the TEC scaffold. Additionally, DNA repair, covalent chromatin modification, "gene gating" at the nuclear pore, Ig gene hypermutation, and sister chromosome cohesion have all been demonstrated or suggested to involve a cotranscriptional component. From this perspective, TECs can be viewed as potent "community organizers" within the nucleus.},

@article{Lefebvre2012,
abstract = {Dendritic arborizations of many neurons are patterned by a process called self-avoidance, in which branches arising from a single neuron repel each other. By minimizing gaps and overlaps within the arborization, self-avoidance facilitates complete coverage of a neuron/'s territory by its neurites. Remarkably, some neurons that display self-avoidance interact freely with other neurons of the same subtype, implying that they discriminate self from non-self. Here we demonstrate roles for the clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) in dendritic self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination. The Pcdh locus encodes 58 related cadherin-like transmembrane proteins, at least some of which exhibit isoform-specific homophilic adhesion in heterologous cells and are expressed stochastically and combinatorially in single neurons. Deletion of all 22 Pcdh genes in the mouse $\gamma$-subcluster (Pcdhg genes) disrupts self-avoidance of dendrites in retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Further genetic analysis of SACs showed that Pcdhg proteins act cell-autonomously during development, and that replacement of the 22 Pcdhg proteins with a single isoform restores self-avoidance. Moreover, expression of the same single isoform in all SACs decreases interactions among dendrites of neighbouring SACs (heteroneuronal interactions). These results suggest that homophilic Pcdhg interactions between sibling neurites (isoneuronal interactions) generate a repulsive signal that leads to self-avoidance. In this model, heteroneuronal interactions are normally permitted because dendrites seldom encounter a matched set of Pcdhg proteins unless they emanate from the same soma. In many respects, our results mirror those reported for Dscam1 (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) in Drosophila: this complex gene encodes thousands of recognition molecules that exhibit stochastic expression and isoform-specific interactions, and mediate both self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination. Thus, although insect Dscam and vertebrate Pcdh proteins share no sequence homology, they seem to underlie similar strategies for endowing neurons with distinct molecular identities and patterning their arborizations.},

The system provides lab technicians standard and customizable sample information forms, barcoded submission forms, tracking of input sample quality, multiplex-capable automatic flow cell design and automatically generated sample sheets to aid physical flow cell preparation. In addition, the platform provides the researcher with a user-friendly interface to create a request, submit accompanying samples, upload sample quality measurements and access to the sequencing results. As the LIMS is within the Galaxy platform, the researcher has access to all Galaxy analysis tools and workflows. The system reports requests and associated information to a message queuing system, such that information can be posted and stored in external systems, such as a wiki. Through an API, raw sequencing results can be automatically pre-processed and uploaded to the appropriate request folder. Developed for the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument, many features are directly applicable to other instruments.

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are revolutionizing genome research, and in particular, their application to transcriptomics (RNA-seq) is increasingly being used for gene expression profiling as a replacement for microarrays. However, the properties of RNA-seq data have not been yet fully established, and additional research is needed for understanding how these data respond to differential expression analysis. In this work, we set out to gain insights into the characteristics of RNA-seq data analysis by studying an important parameter of this technology: the sequencing depth. We have analyzed how sequencing depth affects the detection of transcripts and their identification as differentially expressed, looking at aspects such as transcript biotype, length, expression level, and fold-change. We have evaluated different algorithms available for the analysis of RNA-seq and proposed a novel approach--NOISeq--that differs from existing methods in that it is data-adaptive and nonparametric. Our results reveal that most existing methodologies suffer from a strong dependency on sequencing depth for their differential expression calls and that this results in a considerable number of false positives that increases as the number of reads grows. In contrast, our proposed method models the noise distribution from the actual data, can therefore better adapt to the size of the data set, and is more effective in controlling the rate of false discoveries. This work discusses the true potential of RNA-seq for studying regulation at low expression ranges, the noise within RNA-seq data, and the issue of replication.},

@article{Burnside2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of new, deep sequencing technologies has greatly accelerated microRNA discovery. We have applied this approach to the identification of chicken microRNAs and to the comparison of microRNAs in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) infected with Marek's disease virus (MDV) to those present in uninfected CEF.

RESULTS: We obtained 125,463 high quality reads that showed an exact match to the chicken genome. The majority of the reads corresponded to previously annotated chicken microRNAs; however, the sequences of many potential novel microsRNAs were obtained. A comparison of the reads obtained in MDV-infected and uninfected CEF indicates that infection does not significantly perturb the expression profile of microRNAs. Frequently sequenced microRNAs include miR-221/222, which are thought to play a role in growth and proliferation. A number of microRNAs (e.g., let-7, miR-199a-1, 26a) are expressed at lower levels in MDV-induced tumors, highlighting the potential importance of this class of molecules in tumorigenesis.

CONCLUSION: Deep sequencing technology is highly suited for small RNA discovery. This approach is independent of comparative sequence analysis, which has been the primary method used to identify chicken microRNAs. Our results have confirmed the expression of many microRNAs identified by sequence similarity and identified a pool of candidate novel microRNAs.},

abstract = {Introduction of exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into Caenorhabditis elegans has been shown to specifically and potently disrupt the activity of genes containing homologous sequences. In this study we present evidence that the primary interference effects of dsRNA are post-transcriptional. First, we examined the primary DNA sequence after dsRNA-mediated interference and found no evidence for alterations. Second, we found that dsRNA-mediated interference with the upstream gene in a polar operon had no effect on the activity of the downstream gene; this finding argues against an effect on initiation or elongation of transcription. Third, we observed by in situ hybridization that dsRNA-mediated interference produced a substantial, although not complete, reduction in accumulation of nascent transcripts in the nucleus, while cytoplasmic accumulation of transcripts was virtually eliminated. These results indicate that the endogenous mRNA is the target for interference and suggest a mechanism that degrades the targeted RNA before translation can occur. This mechanism is not dependent on the SMG system, an mRNA surveillance system in C. elegans responsible for targeting and destroying aberrant messages. We suggest a model of how dsRNA might function in a catalytic mechanism to target homologous mRNAs for degradation.},

abstract = {DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling discoveries of important biological or medical benefit. Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants, many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing and many other biomedical applications.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing of nascent transcripts is a widespread mechanism for altering protein expression in response to extracellular stimuli. However, little is known about the sequences that mediate signal-induced alternative splicing, complicating efforts to identify genes whose splicing may be regulated in response to a particular stimuli. Here we define a sequence element that is both the primary determinant of CD45 variable exon exclusion following T cell stimulation by PMA and is sufficient to confer activation-induced skipping of a heterologous exon. Additionally, we show that this regulatory element has homology to sequences in other signal-regulated genes, suggesting that the alternative splicing of large families of genes may be regulated by common signaling pathways.},

abstract = {Proteins of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticles (hnRNP) family form a structurally diverse group of RNA binding proteins implicated in various functions in metazoans. Here we discuss recent advances supporting a role for these proteins in precursor-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing. Heterogeneous nuclear RNP proteins can repress splicing by directly antagonizing the recognition of splice sites, or can interfere with the binding of proteins bound to enhancers. Recently, hnRNP proteins have been shown to hinder communication between factors bound to different splice sites. Conversely, several reports have described a positive role for some hnRNP proteins in pre-mRNA splicing. Moreover, cooperative interactions between bound hnRNP proteins may encourage splicing between specific pairs of splice sites while simultaneously hampering other combinations. Thus, hnRNP proteins utilize a variety of strategies to control splice site selection in a manner that is important for both alternative and constitutive pre-mRNA splicing.},

Here we describe a sensitive and specific assay for parallel analysis of mRNA isoforms on a fiber-optic microarray platform. The method permits analysis of mRNA transcripts without prior RNA purification or cDNA synthesis. Using an endogenously expressed viral transcript as a model, we demonstrated that the assay readily detects mRNA isoforms from as little as 10–100 pg of total cellular RNA or directly from a few cells. Multiplexed analysis of human cancer cell lines revealed differences in mRNA splicing and suggested a potential autocrine mechanism in the development of choriocarcinomas. Our approach may be useful in the large-scale analysis of the role of alternative splicing in development and disease.},

abstract = {Numerous prokaryote genomes contain structures known as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), composed of 25-50 bp repeats separated by unique sequence spacers of similar length. CRISPR structures are found in the vicinity of four genes named cas1 to cas4. In silico analysis revealed another cluster of three genes associated with CRISPR structures in many bacterial species, named here as cas1B, cas5 and cas6, and also revealed a certain number of spacers that have homology with extant genes, most frequently derived from phages, but also derived from other extrachromosomal elements. Sequence analysis of CRISPR structures from 24 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus vestibularis confirmed the homology of spacers with extrachromosomal elements. Phage sensitivity of S. thermophilus strains appears to be correlated with the number of spacers in the CRISPR locus the strain carries. The authors suggest that the spacer elements are the traces of past invasions by extrachromosomal elements, and hypothesize that they provide the cell immunity against phage infection, and more generally foreign DNA expression, by coding an anti-sense RNA. The presence of gene fragments in CRISPR structures and the nuclease motifs in cas genes of both cluster types suggests that CRISPR formation involves a DNA degradation step.},

abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can reveal new genes and splice variants and quantify expression genome-wide in a single assay. The volume and complexity of data from RNA-seq experiments necessitate scalable, fast and mathematically principled analysis software. TopHat and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools for gene discovery and comprehensive expression analysis of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and \~{}1 h of hands-on time.},

Here we present analyses of high-throughput data that imply a relationship between nucleosome positioning and exon definition. First, we have found stable nucleosome occupancy within human and Caenorhabditis elegans exons that is stronger in exons with weak splice sites. Conversely, we have found that pseudoexons--intronic sequences that are not included in mRNAs but are flanked by strong splice sites--show nucleosome depletion. Second, the ratio between nucleosome occupancy within and upstream from the exons correlates with exon-inclusion levels. Third, nucleosomes are positioned central to exons rather than proximal to splice sites. These exonic nucleosomal patterns are also observed in non-expressed genes, suggesting that nucleosome marking of exons exists in the absence of transcription. Our analysis provides a framework that contributes to the understanding of splicing on the basis of chromatin architecture.},

These factors are known to play different roles in ES-cell biology as components of the LIF and BMP signaling pathways, self-renewal regulators, and key reprogramming factors. Our study provides insights into the integration of the signaling pathways into the ES-cell-specific transcription circuitries. Intriguingly, we find specific genomic regions extensively targeted by different TFs. Collectively, the comprehensive mapping of TF-binding sites identifies important features of the transcriptional regulatory networks that define ES-cell identity.},

abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq mammalian transcriptome studies are at an early stage in uncovering cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, transcript processing and editing, and regulatory module activity. Despite great progress recently, substantial challenges remain, including discriminating biological variation from technical noise. Here we apply the SMART-seq single-cell RNA-seq protocol to study the reference lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878. By using spike-in quantification standards we estimate the absolute number of RNA molecules per cell for each gene and find significant variation in total mRNA content, between 50,000 to 300,000 transcripts per cell. We directly measure technical stochasticity by a pool/spilt design, and find that there are significant differences in expression between individual cells, over and above technical variation. Specific gene coexpression modules were preferentially expressed in subsets of individual cells, including one enriched for mRNA processing and splicing factors. We assess cell-to-cell variation in alternative splicing and allelic bias, and report evidence of significant differences in splice site usage that exceed splice variation in the pool/split comparison. Finally, we show that transcriptomes from small pools of 30-100 cells approach the information content and reproducibility of contemporary RNA-seq from large amounts of input material. Together, our results define an experimental and computational path forward for analyzing gene expression in rare cell types and cell states.},

abstract = {Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are ≈30 nucleotide noncoding RNAs that may be involved in transposon silencing in mammalian germline cells. Most piRNA sequences are found in a small number of genomic regions referred to as clusters, which range from 1 to hundreds of kilobases. We studied the evolution of 140 rodent piRNA clusters, 103 of which do not overlap protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 14 clusters were acquired after rat–mouse divergence and another 44 after rodent–primate divergence. Most clusters originated in a process analogous to the duplication of protein-coding genes by ectopic recombination, via insertions of long sequences that were mediated by flanking chromosome-specific repetitive elements (REs). Source sequences for such insertions are often located on the same chromosomes and also harbor clusters. The rate of piRNA cluster expansion is higher than that of any known gene family and, in contrast to other large gene families, there was not a single cluster loss. These observations suggest that piRNA cluster expansion is driven by positive selection, perhaps caused by the need to silence the ever-expanding repertoire of mammalian transposons.},

abstract = {<p>Summary<br/>While the long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute a large portion of the mammalian transcriptome, their biological functions has remained elusive. A few long ncRNAs that have been studied in any detail silence gene expression in processes such as X-inactivation and imprinting. We used a GENCODE annotation of the human genome to characterize over a thousand long ncRNAs that are expressed in multiple cell lines. Unexpectedly, we found an enhancer-like function for a set of these long ncRNAs in human cell lines. Depletion of a number of ncRNAs led to decreased expression of their neighboring protein-coding genes, including the master regulator of hematopoiesis, SCL (also called TAL1), Snai1 and Snai2. Using heterologous transcription assays we demonstrated a requirement for the ncRNAs in activation of gene expression. These results reveal an unanticipated role for a class of long ncRNAs in activation of critical regulators of development and differentiation.PaperClip<br/></p>},

Little is known about the cross-talk between chromatin structure and exon-intron architecture. By analysis of genome-wide nucleosome-positioning data sets from humans, flies and worms, we found that exons show increased nucleosome-occupancy levels with respect to introns, a finding that we link to differential GC content and nucleosome-disfavoring elements between exons and introns. Analysis of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation data in humans and mice revealed four specific post-translational histone modifications enriched in exons. Our findings indicate that previously described enrichment of H3K36me3 modifications in exons reflects a more fundamental phenomenon, namely increased nucleosome occupancy along exons. Our results suggest an RNA polymerase II-mediated cross-talk between chromatin structure and exon-intron architecture, implying that exon selection may be modulated by chromatin structure.},

CB components include Mili, Miwi, and Tudor domain proteins such as Tdrd6, whose contribution to CB structure and function is elusive. RESULTS: We determined gametogenesis stage- and male-specific expression and localization of Tdrd6, identified a C-terminally truncated form as predominant after meiosis I, and demonstrated direct physical interaction of Tdrd6 with the CB components Mili and Miwi. Development from round into elongated spermatids is abrogated in Tdrd6(-/-) mice. Their round spermatids bear "ghost" CBs, whose architecture is greatly disrupted. Mael, Miwi, and Mvh do not localize to the Tdrd6-deficient CBs, but retrotransposons are not significantly activated. However, more than 50 miRNAs are more abundant in Tdrd6(-/-) testes, as are exemplary pre- and pri-miRNAs. CONCLUSION: We conclude that Tdrd6 is essential for spermiogenesis, for CB structure, and for proper mature and precursor miRNA expression.},

abstract = {In mammalian meiosis, homologous chromosome synapsis is coupled with recombination. As in most eukaryotes, mammalian meiocytes have checkpoints that monitor the fidelity of these processes. We report that the mouse ortholog (Trip13) of pachytene checkpoint 2 (PCH2), an essential component of the synapsis checkpoint in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans, is required for completion of meiosis in both sexes. TRIP13-deficient mice exhibit spermatocyte death in pachynema and loss of oocytes around birth. The chromosomes of mutant spermatocytes synapse fully, yet retain several markers of recombination intermediates, including RAD51, BLM, and RPA. These chromosomes also exhibited the chiasmata markers MLH1 and MLH3, and okadaic acid treatment of mutant spermatocytes caused progression to metaphase I with bivalent chromosomes. Double mutant analysis demonstrated that the recombination and synapsis genes Spo11, Mei1, Rec8, and Dmc1 are all epistatic to Trip13, suggesting that TRIP13 does not have meiotic checkpoint function in mice. Our data indicate that TRIP13 is required after strand invasion for completing a subset of recombination events, but possibly not those destined to be crossovers. To our knowledge, this is the first model to separate recombination defects from asynapsis in mammalian meiosis, and provides the first evidence that unrepaired DNA damage alone can trigger the pachytene checkpoint response in mice.},

Do they universally have function, or are they merely transcriptional by-products of conventional coding genes? A glimpse into the molecular biology of multiple emerging lncRNA systems reveals the "Wild West" landscape of their functions and mechanisms and the key problems to solve in the years ahead toward understanding these intriguing macromolecules.},

abstract = {1Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-Oncology, The Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New York, New York 10021 The importance of alternative splicing in the regulation of diverse biological processes is reflected in the growing list of human diseases associated with known or suspected splicing defects. It is becoming evident that alternative splicing plays a particularly important role in neurologic disease, which is perhaps not surprising given the important role splicing plays in generating complexity and function in the brain. This review considers the evidence that defects in regulation of splicing may underlie many types of human neurologic diseases. Thirty years have passed since the unexpected discovery that the protein-coding (exonic) sequences of genes are separated by relatively large noncoding (intronic) sequences. Pre-mRNA splicing is the process in which these long precursor (pre-) mRNAs are processed into the mature forms found in the cytoplasm via the precise joining of exonic sequences and the removal of introns that can be hundreds of kilobases long (Figure 1). Splicing is accomplished by a large macromolecular complex termed the spliceosome, which consists of numerous proteins and small RNAs (snRNPs; Rappsilber et al., 2002 and Zhou et al., 2002). The spliceosome recognizes specific sequences in pre-mRNA to define intron-exon boundaries and to facilitate splicing (Figure 1). The activity of the spliceosome can be regulated by multiple splicing activator and repressor proteins that are bound to enhancer and silencer elements, respectively, in the pre-mRNA (reviewed in Black, 2003). Alternative splicing is the process by which different combinations of exons are included in the mature mRNA, thus allowing a single gene to encode multiple protein isoforms with altered or potentially antagonistic properties. Remarkably, some genes can yield hundreds and potentially thousands of unique isoforms. For example, due to the large number of alternative exons present in the three neurexin genes, alternative splicing can generate nearly 3000 unique mRNAs (Missler and Sudhof, 1998) encoding a potentially huge array of synaptic molecules. An emerging theme in molecular neurobiology is that alternative splicing may generate cell-specific combinations of protein isoforms that define the functional properties of the cell and underlie complex processes in the nervous system such as synaptic adhesion and plasticity (Boucard et al., 2005 and Ule and Darnell, 2006). Here we review evidence that splicing misregulation plays a crucial role in the development of neurologic diseases. Alternative splicing is highly abundant in brain relative to other tissues (Blencowe, 2006 and Yeo et al., 2004), where it can influence neurophysiology through spatial and temporal alterations in proteins that comprise ion channels and membrane-bound receptors and are involved in neurotransmitter storage and release (Grabowski and Black, 2001, Lipscombe, 2005 and Stamm et al., 2005). In the nervous system, regulated alternative splicing allows the cell to “fine-tune” its protein composition in order to respond and adapt to different stimuli. Activity-induced changes in the alternative splicing of many pre-mRNAs have been described, including those that encode clathrin light chain B, c-src, NMDA NR1, PMCA, and AChE (Daoud et al., 1999, Lipscombe, 2005, Pick et al., 2004, Strehler and Zacharias, 2001, Vallano et al., 1999 and Xie and Black, 2001). Alternative splicing of NMDAR1 pre-mRNAs represents an excellent example of how the regulated production of different protein isoforms can influence receptor properties and consequently cell physiology (Bradley et al., 2006, Ehlers et al., 1996, Mu et al., 2003 and Xie and Black, 2001). Alternative splicing patterns are dependent on the net result of multiple interactions between RNA binding proteins bound to regulatory elements in the pre-mRNAs (Black, 2003). As a result, differences in the regulation of splicing activator and repressor proteins may be able to affect the alternative splicing of different pre-mRNAs that share common regulatory elements or “splice codes” (Goren et al., 2006, Han et al., 2005, Ule and Darnell, 2006, Ule et al., 2006 and Wang et al., 2004). Such regulation through combinatorial control could allow alternative splicing patterns of multiple pre-mRNAs to be altered in response to changes in the level or activity of a single splicing factor, a mechanism believed to underlie the establishment and maintenance of tissue- and developmental-stage-specific gene expression pathways (Jensen et al., 2000, Ule et al., 2003, Ule et al., 2005 and Xu et al., 2005). Consequently, disrupting the function of a single RNA binding protein can affect many alternatively spliced transcripts, a phenomenon that is increasingly recognized as having a role in human diseases. In this review, we present examples of the different types of neurologic diseases with links to alternative splicing (Table 1). The reader is directed to other excellent recent reviews that discuss the roles of RNA binding proteins and alternative splicing in human diseases in general (Caceres and Kornblihtt, 2002, Cartegni et al., 2002 and Faustino and Cooper, 2003). In one set of neurologic diseases involving splicing defects, mutations within the disease-causing gene alter sequences important for the proper splicing of the resulting pre-mRNA (Figure 2), and we refer to these as cis-acting splicing disorders. It is estimated that at least 15\% (Krawczak et al., 1992), and perhaps as many as 50\% (see “The Phakomatoses,” below), of point mutations that result in human disease cause cis-acting defects in pre-mRNA splicing. These mutations may weaken or strengthen splicing enhancer and silencer elements, as well as create or destroy splice sites. As a result, the splicing of constitutive and alternative exons is altered, cryptic splice sites activated, or intronic sequences retained in the mature mRNA. Specific examples of cis-acting mutations and their consequences in neurologic disease follow. Ataxia-telangiectasia and neurofibromatosis are two of a group of autosomal dominant disorders (the phakomatoses) associated with neurologic disease and a predisposition for malignancies; both disorders have been recently found to be associated in some patients with mutations altering pre-mRNA splicing. For example, a 4 base-pair deletion in intron 20 of the ataxia-telengiectasia mutated (ATM) gene can result in the activation of a cryptic exon and is directly responsible for ataxia-telengiectasia in an affected individual (Pagani et al., 2002). More generally, an unusually high number of ataxia-telengiectasia and neurofibromatosis type 1 patients (50\%) have mutations that affect pre-mRNA splicing (Ars et al., 2000 and Teraoka et al., 1999). As emphasized by Cartegni et al. (2002), these studies highlight the importance of comparing DNA and the resulting mRNA sequences in order to determine whether silent or missense mutations might also change alternative splicing patterns. In ataxia-telengiectasia and neurofibromatosis type 1, such careful sequencing of DNA and mRNA from patients has expanded the list of disease-causing mutations due to aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. Continued efforts to define auxiliary elements that function as enhancers and suppressors of exon splicing will undoubtedly lead to an improved ability to predict which disease-causing mutations affect pre-mRNA splicing. The need to properly control the relative levels of protein isoforms generated by splicing is underscored by the disorder termed frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17). FTDP-17 is an autosomal dominant disorder in which cis-acting mutations result in splicing defects in the transcript encoding MAPT, the microtubule-associated protein tau that is enriched in axons of mature and growing neurons. MAPT gives rise to multiple transcripts that are alternatively spliced and regulated in a developmental and tissue-specific manner. The association of tau with microtubules is dependent on C-terminal repetitive microtubule binding domains encoded by exons 9 through 12. The number of repeat domains (R) encoded in the MAPT transcript, either 3 or 4, is developmentally regulated through the exclusion or inclusion, respectively, of exon 10, and can influence the efficiency with which tau promotes microtubule assembly (Buee et al., 2000). Perturbation of the ratio of 4R- to 3R-containing protein isoforms can lead to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neurodegeneration (Lee et al., 2001). Several mutations clustered around exon 10 which lead to increased levels of exon 10-containing isoforms in humans have been characterized. These include missense mutations that are presumed to create or disrupt a splicing enhancer or silencer, respectively (D'Souza et al., 1999, Hasegawa et al., 1999 and Jiang et al., 2003), as well as mutations that disrupt the formation of an RNA stem-loop structure at the 5′ splice site (SS) of exon 10, which normally functions to restrict spliceosome assembly (Grover et al., 1999). Such structural causes of altered splicing are difficult to document and may be more widespread than currently appreciated. Finally, while the splicing of MAPT exon 10 has been most extensively studied for its role in the pathology in FTDP-17, altered splicing of MAPT exons 2, 3, and 6 have also been observed and implicated in the pathology of other diseases, including gliopathy, spinal cord degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, and myotonic dystrophy (DM; see below) (Andreadis, 2005, Glatz et al., 2006, Leroy et al., 2006 and Sergeant et al., 2001). Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord (Monani, 2005). SMA results from insufficient levels of th},

abstract = {In contrast to existing estimates of approximately 200 murine imprinted genes, recent work based on transcriptome sequencing uncovered parent-of-origin allelic effects at more than 1,300 loci in the developing brain and two adult brain regions, including hundreds present in only males or females. Our independent replication of the embryonic brain stage, where the majority of novel imprinted genes were discovered and the majority of previously known imprinted genes confirmed, resulted in only 12.9\% concordance among the novel imprinted loci. Further analysis and pyrosequencing-based validation revealed that the vast majority of the novel reported imprinted loci are false-positives explained by technical and biological variation of the experimental approach. We show that allele-specific expression (ASE) measured with RNA-Seq is not accurately modeled with statistical methods that assume random independent sampling and that systematic error must be accounted for to enable accurate identification of imprinted expression. Application of a robust approach that accounts for these effects revealed 50 candidate genes where allelic bias was predicted to be parent-of-origin-dependent. However, 11 independent validation attempts through a range of allelic expression biases confirmed only 6 of these novel cases. The results emphasize the importance of independent validation and suggest that the number of imprinted genes is much closer to the initial estimates.},

abstract = {PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence retrotransposons in Drosophila germ lines by associating with the PIWI proteins Argonaute 3 (AGO3), Aubergine (Aub) and Piwi. piRNAs in Drosophila are produced from intergenic repetitive genes and piRNA clusters by two systems: the primary processing pathway and the amplification loop. The amplification loop occurs in a Dicer-independent, PIWI-Slicer-dependent manner. However, primary piRNA processing remains elusive. Here we analysed piRNA processing in a Drosophila ovarian somatic cell line where Piwi, but not Aub or AGO3, is expressed; thus, only the primary piRNAs exist. In addition to flamenco, a Piwi-specific piRNA cluster, traffic jam (tj), a large Maf gene, was determined as a new piRNA cluster. piRNAs arising from tj correspond to the untranslated regions of tj messenger RNA and are sense-oriented. piRNA loading on to Piwi may occur in the cytoplasm. zucchini, a gene encoding a putative cytoplasmic nuclease, is required for tj-derived piRNA production. In tj and piwi mutant ovaries, somatic cells fail to intermingle with germ cells and Fasciclin III is overexpressed. Loss of tj abolishes Piwi expression in gonadal somatic cells. Thus, in gonadal somatic cells, tj gives rise simultaneously to two different molecules: the TJ protein, which activates Piwi expression, and piRNAs, which define the Piwi targets for silencing.},

abstract = {Many genes with important roles in development and disease contain exceptionally long introns, but special mechanisms for their expression have not been investigated. We present bioinformatic, phylogenetic, and experimental evidence in Drosophila for a mechanism that subdivides many large introns by recursive splicing at nonexonic elements and alternative exons. Recursive splice sites predicted with highly stringent criteria are found at much higher frequency than expected in the sense strands of introns >20 kb, but they are found only at the expected frequency on the antisense strands, and they are underrepresented within introns <10 kb. The predicted sites in long introns are highly conserved between Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, despite extensive divergence of other sequences within the same introns. These patterns of enrichment and conservation indicate that recursive splice sites are advantageous in the context of long introns. Experimental analyses of in vivo processing intermediates and lariat products from four large introns in the unrelated genes kuzbanian, outspread, and Ultrabithorax confirmed that these introns are removed by a series of recursive splicing steps using the predicted nonexonic sites. Mutation of nonexonic site RP3 within Ultrabithorax also confirmed that recursive splicing is the predominant processing pathway even with a shortened version of the intron. We discuss currently known and potential roles for recursive splicing.},

These fragments, or ‘reads’, can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites.Results: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72\% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20 000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development.Availability: TopHat is free, open-source software available from http://tophat.cbcb.umd.eduContact: cole@cs.umd.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Whereas PBCV-1 ligase efficiently joins a 3'-OH RNA to a 5'-phosphate DNA, it is unable to join a 3'-OH DNA to a 5'-phosphate RNA. The ligase discriminates at the substrate binding step between nicked duplexes containing 5'-phosphate DNA versus 5'-phosphate RNA strands. PBCV-1 ligase readily seals a nicked duplex DNA containing a single ribonucleotide substitution at the reactive 5'-phosphate end. These results suggest a requirement for a B-form helical conformation of the polynucleotide on the 5'-phosphate side of the nick. Single base mismatches at the nick exert disparate effects on DNA ligation efficiency. PBCV-1 ligase tolerates mismatches involving the 5'-phosphate nucleotide, with the exception of 5'-A:G and 5'-G:A mispairs, which reduce ligase activity by two orders of magnitude. Inhibitory configurations at the 3'-OH nucleotide include 3'-G:A, 3'-G:T, 3'-T:T, 3'-A:G, 3'-G:G, 3'-A:C and 3'-C:C.

@article{LawrenceZipursky2013,
abstract = {Self-avoidance, the tendency of neurites of the same cell to selectively avoid each other, is a property of both vertebrate and invertebrate neurons. In Drosophila, self-avoidance is mediated by a large family of cell recognition molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily encoded, via alternative splicing, by the Dscam1 locus. Dscam1 promotes self-avoidance in dendrites, axons, and prospective postsynaptic elements. Expression analysis suggests that each neuron expresses a unique combination of isoforms. Identical isoforms on sister neurites exhibit isoform-specific homophilic recognition and elicit repulsion between processes, thereby promoting self-avoidance. Although any isoform can promote self-avoidance, thousands are necessary to ensure that neurites readily discriminate between self and nonself. Recent studies indicate that a large family of cadherins in the mouse, i.e., the clustered protocadherins, functions in an analogous fashion to promote self-avoidance. These studies argue for the evolution of a common molecular strategy for self-avoidance.},

Indeed, at promoters, we identified a number of distinct signatures, each associated with a different class of expressed and functional genes. We also observed several unexpected signatures marking exons that directly correlate with the expression of exons. Finally, we recovered many places marked by two distinct repressive modifications, and showed that they mark distinct populations of repetitive elements associated with distinct modes of gene repression. Together, these results highlight the rich information embedded in the human epigenome and underscore its value in studying gene regulation.},

Here, we identify an evolutionarily conserved embryonic stem cell (ESC)-specific AS event that changes the DNA-binding preference of the forkhead family transcription factor FOXP1. We show that the ESC-specific isoform of FOXP1 stimulates the expression of transcription factor genes required for pluripotency, including OCT4, NANOG, NR5A2, and GDF3, while concomitantly repressing genes required for ESC differentiation. This isoform also promotes the maintenance of ESC pluripotency and contributes to efficient reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. These results reveal a pivotal role for an AS event in the regulation of pluripotency through the control of critical ESC-specific transcriptional programs.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Alternative splicing and other processes that allow for different transcripts to be derived from the same gene are significant forces in the eukaryotic cell. RNA-Seq is a promising technology for analyzing alternative transcripts, as it does not require prior knowledge of transcript structures or genome sequences. However, analysis of RNA-Seq data in the presence of genes with large numbers of alternative transcripts is currently challenging due to efficiency, identifiability and representation issues. RESULTS: We present RNA-Seq models and associated inference algorithms based on the concept of probabilistic splice graphs, which alleviate these issues. We prove that our models are often identifiable and demonstrate that our inference methods for quantification and differential processing detection are efficient and accurate.

abstract = {UNLABELLED: A motif is a short DNA or protein sequence that contributes to the biological function of the sequence in which it resides. Over the past several decades, many computational methods have been described for identifying, characterizing and searching with sequence motifs. Critical to nearly any motif-based sequence analysis pipeline is the ability to scan a sequence database for occurrences of a given motif described by a position-specific frequency matrix.

RESULTS: We describe Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO), a software tool for scanning DNA or protein sequences with motifs described as position-specific scoring matrices. The program computes a log-likelihood ratio score for each position in a given sequence database, uses established dynamic programming methods to convert this score to a P-value and then applies false discovery rate analysis to estimate a q-value for each position in the given sequence. FIMO provides output in a variety of formats, including HTML, XML and several Santa Cruz Genome Browser formats. The program is efficient, allowing for the scanning of DNA sequences at a rate of 3.5 Mb/s on a single CPU. Availability and Implementation: FIMO is part of the MEME Suite software toolkit. A web server and source code are available at http://meme.sdsc.edu.},

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticle (hnRNP) proteins form a family of RNA-binding proteins that coat nascent pre-mRNAs. Many but not all major hnRNP proteins have been shown to participate in splicing control. The range and specificity of hnRNP protein action remain poorly documented, even for those affecting splice site selection. We used RNA interference and a reverse transcription-PCR screening platform to examine the implications of 14 of the major hnRNP proteins in the splicing of 56 alternative splicing events in apoptotic genes. Out of this total of 784 alternative splicing reactions tested in three human cell lines, 31 responded similarly to a knockdown in at least two different cell lines. On the other hand, the impact of other hnRNP knockdowns was cell line specific. The broadest effects were obtained with hnRNP K and C, two proteins whose role in alternative splicing had not previously been firmly established. Different hnRNP proteins affected distinct sets of targets with little overlap even between closely related hnRNP proteins. Overall, our study highlights the potential contribution of all of these major hnRNP proteins in alternative splicing control and shows that the targets for individual hnRNP proteins can vary in different cellular contexts.},

abstract = {Core RNA-processing reactions in eukaryotic cells occur cotranscriptionally in a chromatin context, but the relationship between chromatin structure and pre-mRNA processing is poorly understood. We observed strong nucleosome depletion around human polyadenylation sites (PAS) and nucleosome enrichment just downstream of PAS. In genes with multiple alternative PAS, higher downstream nucleosome affinity was associated with higher PAS usage, independently of known PAS motifs that function at the RNA level. Conversely, exons were associated with distinct peaks in nucleosome density. Exons flanked by long introns or weak splice sites exhibited stronger nucleosome enrichment, and incorporation of nucleosome density data improved splicing simulation accuracy. Certain histone modifications, including H3K36me3 and H3K27me2, were specifically enriched on exons, suggesting active marking of exon locations at the chromatin level. Together, these findings provide evidence for extensive functional connections between chromatin structure and RNA processing.},

abstract = {Distal intraexon (iE) regulatory elements in 4.1R pre-mRNA govern 3′ splice site choice at exon 2 (E2) via nested splicing events, ultimately modulating expression of N-terminal isoforms of cytoskeletal 4.1R protein. Here we explored intrasplicing in other normal and disease gene contexts and found conservation of intrasplicing through vertebrate evolution. In the paralogous 4.1B gene, we identified ∼120 kb upstream of E2 an ultradistal intraexon, iEB, that mediates intrasplicing by promoting two intricately coupled splicing events that ensure selection of a weak distal acceptor at E2 (E2dis) by prior excision of the competing proximal acceptor (E2prox). Mutating iEB in minigene splicing reporters abrogated intrasplicing, as did blocking endogenous iEB function with antisense morpholinos in live mouse and zebrafish animal models. In a human elliptocytosis patient with a mutant 4.1R gene lacking E2 through E4, we showed that aberrant splicing is consistent with iER-mediated intrasplicing at the first available exons downstream of iER, namely, alternative E5 and constitutive E6. Finally, analysis of heterologous acceptor contexts revealed a strong preference for nested 3′ splice events at consecutive pairs of AG dinucleotides. Distal regulatory elements may control intrasplicing at a subset of alternative 3′ splice sites in vertebrate pre-mRNAs to generate proteins with functional diversity.},

In this study, we examine the extent of alternative splicing in human cells using deep RNA sequencing and de novo identification of splice junctions. We demonstrate the existence of a large class of low abundance isoforms, encompassing approximately 150,000 previously unannotated splice junctions in our data. Newly-identified splice sites show little evidence of evolutionary conservation, suggesting that the majority are due to erroneous splice site choice. We show that sequence motifs involved in the recognition of exons are enriched in the vicinity of unconserved splice sites. We estimate that the average intron has a splicing error rate of approximately 0.7\% and show that introns in highly expressed genes are spliced more accurately, likely due to their shorter length. These results implicate noisy splicing as an important property of genome evolution.},

@article{Schwarzbauer1989,
abstract = {We demonstrate that the alternatively spliced variable (V) region of fibronectin (FN) is required for secretion of FN dimers during biosynthesis. Alternative splicing of the V segment of the rat FN transcript generates three subunit variants (V120, V95, V0) that differ by the inclusion or omission of an additional 120 or 95 amino acids. We are exploring the functions of this segment by expressing variant cDNAs in normal and transformed fibroblasts. Like FN itself, the cDNA-encoded polypeptides (deminectins [DNs]) containing the V120 or V95 segment are efficiently secreted as disulfide-bonded homodimers. However, few homodimers of DNs lacking this region, V0 DNs, are secreted. V0 homodimers do form inside the cell, as demonstrated by biosynthetic analyses of dimer formation and secretion using pulse-chase and time course experiments, but these dimers seldom reach the cell surface and are probably degraded intracellularly. Coexpression of V0 and V120 subunits results in intracellular formation of three types of dimers, V0-V0, V0-V120, and V120-V120, but only the V120-containing dimers are secreted. This selective retention of V0 homodimers indicates that the V region is required for formation and secretion of native FN dimers. In an analogous in vivo situation, we show that plasma FN also lacks V0-V0 dimers and consists of V0-V+ and V+-V+ combinations. Dissection of V region sequences by deletion mapping localizes the major site involved in DN dimer secretion to an 18-amino acid segment within V95. In addition, high levels of dimer secretion can be restored by insertion of V into a heterologous site 10 kD COOH terminal to its normal location. We discuss the potential role of intracellular protein-protein interactions in FN dimer formation.},

abstract = {During development, cells start in a pluripotent state, from which they can differentiate into many cell types, and progressively develop a narrower potential. Their gene-expression programmes become more defined, restricted and, potentially, 'locked in'. Pluripotent stem cells express genes that encode a set of core transcription factors, while genes that are required later in development are repressed by histone marks, which confer short-term, and therefore flexible, epigenetic silencing. By contrast, the methylation of DNA confers long-term epigenetic silencing of particular sequences — transposons, imprinted genes and pluripotency-associated genes — in somatic cells. Long-term silencing can be reprogrammed by demethylation of DNA, and this process might involve DNA repair. It is not known whether any of the epigenetic marks has a primary role in determining cell and lineage commitment during development.},

Furthermore, mRNAs of ACT (activator of CREM in testis) and CREM target genes are downregulated in miwinull testes. Whereas MIWI and CREM do not regulate each other's expression, MIWI complexes with mRNAs of ACT and CREM target genes. Hence, MIWI may control spermiogenesis by regulating the stability of these mRNAs.},

Thus, understanding the molecular basis of alternative splicing is essential for deciphering post-transcriptional control of the genome. Pre-mRNA splicing in general is catalyzed by a large dynamic macromolecular machine known as the spliceosome. Notably, the recognition of the intron substrate by spliceosomal components and the assembly of these components to form a catalytic spliceosome occur through a network of highly combinatorial molecular interactions. Many, if not all, of these interactions are subject to regulation, forming the basis of alternative splicing. This minireview focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the diversity of mechanisms by which the spliceosome can be regulated so as to achieve precise control of alternative splicing under a range of cellular conditions.},

What renders 2\% of the mammalian genomes permissive to meiotic recombination by allowing Spo11 endonuclease to initiate double-strand breaks is largely unknown. Work in yeast has shown that chromatin accessibility seems to be important for this activity. Here, we define nucleosome profiles and dynamics at four mouse recombination hotspots by purifying highly enriched fractions of meiotic cells. We found that nucleosome occupancy is generally stable during meiosis progression. Interestingly, the cores of recombination hotspots have largely open chromatin structure, and the localization of the few nucleosomes present in these cores correlates precisely with the crossover-free zones in recombinogenic domains. Collectively, these high-resolution studies suggest that nucleosome occupancy seems to direct, at least in part, how meiotic recombination events are processed.},

abstract = {PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small RNAs abundantly expressed in animal gonads. piRNAs that map to retrotransposons are generated by a “ping-pong” amplification loop to suppress the activity of retrotransposons. However, the biogenesis and function of other categories of piRNAs have yet to be investigated. In this study, we first profiled the expression of small RNAs in type A spermatogonia, pachytene spermatocytes, and round spermatids by deep sequencing. We then focused on the computational analysis of the potential piRNAs generated in the present study as well as other published sets. piRNAs mapping to retrotransposons, mRNAs, and intergenic regions had different length distributions and were differentially regulated in spermatogenesis. piRNA-generating mRNAs (PRMRs), whose expression positively correlated with their piRNA products, constituted one-third of the protein-coding genes and were evolutionarily conserved and enriched with splicing isoforms and antisense transcripts. PRMRs with piRNAs preferentially mapped to CDSs and 3′ UTRs partitioned into three clusters differentially expressed during spermatogenesis and enriched with unique sets of functional annotation terms related to housekeeping activities as well as spermatogenesis-specific processes. Intergenic piRNAs were divided into 2992 clusters probably representing novel transcriptional units that have not been reported. The transcripts of a large number of genes involved in spermatogenesis are the precursors of piRNAs, and these genes are intricately regulated by alternative splicing and antisense transcripts. piRNAs, whose regulatory role in gene expression awaits to be identified, are clearly products of a novel regulatory process that needs to be defined.},

Recent results have revealed the historical recombination rates and the distribution of hotspots across the human genome. Surprisingly, CO hotspots are highly dynamic, as shown by differences in activity between individuals, populations and closely related species. We propose a role for DNA methylation in preventing the formation of COs, a regulation that might explain, in part, the correlation between recombination rates and GC content in mammals.},

abstract = {Many studies are uncovering functional roles for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), yet few have been tested for in vivo relevance through genetic ablation in animal models. To investigate the functional relevance of lncRNAs in various physiological conditions, we have developed a collection of 18 lncRNA knockout strains in which the locus is maintained transcriptionally active. Initial characterization revealed peri- and postnatal lethal phenotypes in three mutant strains (Fendrr, Peril, and Mdgt), the latter two exhibiting incomplete penetrance and growth defects in survivors. We also report growth defects for two additional mutant strains (linc-Brn1b and linc-Pint). Further analysis revealed defects in lung, gastrointestinal tract, and heart in Fendrr(-/-) neonates, whereas linc-Brn1b(-/-) mutants displayed distinct abnormalities in the generation of upper layer II-IV neurons in the neocortex. This study demonstrates that lncRNAs play critical roles in vivo and provides a framework and impetus for future larger-scale functional investigation into the roles of lncRNA molecules.

abstract = {Alternative mRNA splicing adds a layer of regulation to the expression of thousands of genes in Drosophila melanogaster. Not all alternative splicing results in functional protein; it can also yield mRNA isoforms with premature stop codons that are degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. This coupling of alternative splicing and NMD provides a mechanism for gene regulation that is highly conserved in mammals. NMD is also active in Drosophila, but its effect on the repertoire of alternative splice forms has been unknown, as has the mechanism by which it recognizes targets. Here, we have employed a custom splicing-sensitive microarray to globally measure the effect of alternative mRNA processing and NMD on Drosophila gene expression. We have developed a new algorithm to infer the expression change of each mRNA isoform of a gene based on the microarray measurements. This method is of general utility for interpreting splicing-sensitive microarrays and high-throughput sequence data. Using this approach, we have identified a high-confidence set of 45 genes where NMD has a differential effect on distinct alternative isoforms, including numerous RNA-binding and ribosomal proteins. Coupled alternative splicing and NMD decrease expression of these genes, which may in turn have a downstream effect on expression of other genes. The NMD-affected genes are enriched for roles in translation and mitosis, perhaps underlying the previously observed role of NMD factors in cell cycle progression. Our results have general implications for understanding the NMD mechanism in fly. Most notably, we found that the NMD-target mRNAs had significantly longer 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) than the nontarget isoforms of the same genes, supporting a role for 3' UTR length in the recognition of NMD targets in fly.},

abstract = {One of the initial steps of neurogenesis in the Drosophila embryo is the delamination of a stereotype set of neural progenitor cells (neuroblasts) from the neuroectoderm. The time window of neuroblast segregation has been divided into five successive waves (S1-S5) in which subsets of neuroblasts with specific identities are formed. To test when identity specification of the various neuroblasts takes place and whether extrinsic signals are involved, we have performed heterochronic transplantation experiments. Single neuroectodermal cells from stage 10 donor embryos (after S2) were transplanted into the neuroectoderm of host embryos at stage 7 (before S1) and vice versa. The fate of these cells was uncovered by their lineages at stage 16/17. Transplanted cells adjusted their fate to the new temporal situation. Late neuroectodermal cells were able to take over the fate of early (S1/S2) neuroblasts. The early neuroectodermal cells preferentially generated late (S4/S5) neuroblasts, despite their reduced time of exposure to the neuroectoderm. Furthermore, neuroblast fates are independent from divisions of neuroectodermal progenitor cells. We conclude from these experiments that neuroblast specification occurs sequentially under the control of non-cell-autonomous and stage-specific inductive signals that act in the neuroectoderm.},

Of the three types of animal small-silencing RNAs—small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and piRNAs—piRNAs are the least well understood, because we lack good tools for studying how they are made and how they function. Brennecke et al have now established a method for triggering RNA interference (RNAi) solely in Drosophila follicle cells, a specialized somatic cell that abuts the developing oocyte and which expresses a simplified version of the piRNA pathway present in animal germ cells. Their initial results already suggest a revision for our model of the piRNA pathway, and promise to accelerate the study of this enigmatic small RNA class.},

abstract = {Transcripts of the human tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) are aberrantly spliced in many cancers. A major aberrant splicing event on the TSG101 pre-mRNA involves joining of distant alternative 5′ and 3′ splice sites within exon 2 and exon 9, respectively, resulting in the extensive elimination of the mRNA. The estimated strengths of the alternative splice sites are much lower than those of authentic splice sites. We observed that the equivalent aberrant mRNA could be generated from an intron-less TSG101 gene expressed ectopically in breast cancer cells. Remarkably, we identified a pathway-specific endogenous lariat RNA consisting solely of exonic sequences, predicted to be generated by a re-splicing between exon 2 and exon 9 on the spliced mRNA. Our results provide evidence for a two-step splicing pathway in which the initial constitutive splicing removes all 14 authentic splice sites, thereby bringing the weak alternative splice sites into close proximity. We also demonstrate that aberrant multiple-exon skipping of the fragile histidine triad (FHIT) pre-mRNA in cancer cells occurs via re-splicing of spliced FHIT mRNA. The re-splicing of mature mRNA can potentially generate mutation-independent diversity in cancer transcriptomes. Conversely, a mechanism may exist in normal cells to prevent potentially deleterious mRNA re-splicing events.},

abstract = {The genome is extensively transcribed into long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), many of which are implicated in gene silencing. Potential roles of lincRNAs in gene activation are much less understood. Development and homeostasis require coordinate regulation of neighbouring genes through a process termed locus control. Some locus control elements and enhancers transcribe lincRNAs, hinting at possible roles in long-range control. In vertebrates, 39 Hox genes, encoding homeodomain transcription factors critical for positional identity, are clustered in four chromosomal loci; the Hox genes are expressed in nested anterior-posterior and proximal-distal patterns colinear with their genomic position from 3' to 5'of the cluster. Here we identify HOTTIP, a lincRNA transcribed from the 5' tip of the HOXA locus that coordinates the activation of several 5' HOXA genes in vivo. Chromosomal looping brings HOTTIP into close proximity to its target genes. HOTTIP RNA binds the adaptor protein WDR5 directly and targets WDR5/MLL complexes across HOXA, driving histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation and gene transcription. Induced proximity is necessary and sufficient for HOTTIP RNA activation of its target genes. Thus, by serving as key intermediates that transmit information from higher order chromosomal looping into chromatin modifications, lincRNAs may organize chromatin domains to coordinate long-range gene activation.},

abstract = {Host tRNAs cleaved near the anticodon occur specifically in T4-infected Escherichia coli prr strains which restrict polynucleotide kinase (pnk) or RNA ligase (rli) phage mutants. The cleavage products are transient with wt but accumulate in pnk- or rli- infections, implicating the affected enzymes in repair of the damaged tRNAs. Their roles in the pathway were elucidated by comparing the mutant infection intermediates with intact tRNA counterparts before or late in wt infection. Thus, the T4-induced anticodon nuclease cleaves lysine tRNA 5' to the wobble position, yielding 2':3'-P greater than and 5'-OH termini. Polynucleotide kinase converts them into a 3'-OH and 5' P pair joined in turn by RNA ligase. Presumably, lysine tRNA depletion, in the absence of polynucleotide kinase and RNA ligase mediated repair, underlies prr restriction. However, the nuclease, kinase and ligase may benefit T4 directly, by adapting levels or decoding specificities of host tRNAs to T4 codon usage.},

Since then, an enormous body of evidence has demonstrated the prevalence of alternative splicing in multicellular eukaryotes, its key roles in determining tissue- and species-specific differentiation patterns, the multiple post- and co-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that control it, and its causal role in hereditary disease and cancer. The emerging evidence places alternative splicing in a central position in the flow of eukaryotic genetic information, between transcription and translation, in that it can respond not only to various signalling pathways that target the splicing machinery but also to transcription factors and chromatin structure.},

@article{Bolcun-Filas2011,
abstract = {The transcriptional regulation of mammalian meiosis is poorly characterized, owing to few genetic and ex vivo models. From a genetic screen, we identify the transcription factor MYBL1 as a male-specific master regulator of several crucial meiotic processes. Spermatocytes bearing a novel separation-of-function allele (Mybl1repro9) had subtle defects in autosome synapsis in pachynema, a high incidence of unsynapsed sex chromosomes, incomplete double-strand break repair on synapsed pachytene chromosomes and a lack of crossing over. MYBL1 protein appears in pachynema, and its mutation caused specific alterations in expression of diverse genes, including some translated postmeiotically. These data, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) experiments and bioinformatic analysis of promoters, identified direct targets of MYBL1 regulation. The results reveal that MYBL1 is a master regulator of meiotic genes that are involved in multiple processes in spermatocytes, particularly those required for cell cycle progression through pachynema.},

@article{Johnson2009,
abstract = {Our understanding of the evolution, formation, and pathological disruption of human brain circuits is impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on the developing brain transcriptome. A whole-genome, exon-level expression analysis of 13 regions from left and right sides of the mid-fetal human brain revealed that 76\% of genes are expressed, and 44\% of these are differentially regulated. These data reveal a large number of specific gene expression and alternative splicing patterns, as well as coexpression networks, associated with distinct regions and neurodevelopmental processes. Of particular relevance to cognitive specializations, we have characterized the transcriptional landscapes of prefrontal cortex and perisylvian speech and language areas, which exhibit a population-level global expression symmetry. We show that differentially expressed genes are more frequently associated with human-specific evolution of putative cis-regulatory elements. These data provide a wealth of biological insights into the complex transcriptional and molecular underpinnings of human brain development and evolution.},

@article{Lee2009,
abstract = {New types of small RNAs distinct from microRNAs (miRNAs) are progressively being discovered in various organisms. In order to discover such novel small RNAs, a library of 17- to 26-base-long RNAs was created from prostate cancer cell lines and sequenced by ultra-high-throughput sequencing. A significant number of the sequences are derived from precise processing at the 5′ or 3′ end of mature or precursor tRNAs to form three series of tRFs (tRNA-derived RNA fragments): the tRF-5, tRF-3, and tRF-1 series. These sequences constitute a class of short RNAs that are second most abundant to miRNAs. Northern hybridization, quantitative RT–PCR, and splinted ligation assays independently measured the levels of at least 17 tRFs. To demonstrate the biological importance of tRFs, we further investigated tRF-1001, derived from the 3′ end of a Ser-TGA tRNA precursor transcript that is not retained in the mature tRNA. tRF-1001 is expressed highly in a wide range of cancer cell lines but much less in tissues, and its expression in cell lines was tightly correlated with cell proliferation. siRNA-mediated knockdown of tRF-1001 impaired cell proliferation with the specific accumulation of cells in G2, phenotypes that were reversed specifically by cointroducing a synthetic 2′-O-methyl tRF-1001 oligoribonucleotide resistant to the siRNA. tRF-1001 is generated in the cytoplasm by tRNA 3′-endonuclease ELAC2, a prostate cancer susceptibility gene. Our data suggest that tRFs are not random by-products of tRNA degradation or biogenesis, but an abundant and novel class of short RNAs with precise sequence structure that have specific expression patterns and specific biological roles.},

T4 Pnk is a homotetramer composed of a C-terminal phosphatase domain and an N-terminal kinase domain. The 2.0 A crystal structure of the isolated kinase domain highlights a tunnel-like active site through the heart of the enzyme, with an entrance on the 5' OH acceptor side that can accommodate a single-stranded polynucleotide. The active site is composed of essential side chains that coordinate the beta phosphate of the NTP donor and the 3' phosphate of the 5' OH acceptor, plus a putative general acid that activates the 5' OH. The structure rationalizes the different specificities of T4 and eukaryotic Pnk and suggests a model for the assembly of the tetramer.},

abstract = {The Drosophila Dscam gene encodes 38,016 different proteins, due to alternative splicing of 95 of its 115 exons, that function in axon guidance and innate immunity. The alternative exons are organized into four clusters, and the exons within each cluster are spliced in a mutually exclusive manner. Here we describe an evolutionarily conserved RNA secondary structure we call the Inclusion Stem (iStem) that is required for efficient inclusion of all 12 variable exons in the exon 4 cluster. Although the iStem governs inclusion or exclusion of the entire exon 4 cluster, it does not play a significant role in determining which variable exon is selected. Thus, the iStem is a novel type of regulatory element that simultaneously controls the splicing of multiple alternative exons.},

abstract = {Multiple isoforms of the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 are expressed on the surface of human T cells. Interestingly, the expression of these isoforms has been shown to vary significantly upon T-cell activation. In this report, we describe a novel cell line-based model system in which we can mimic the activation-induced alternative splicing of CD45 observed in primary T cells. Of the many proximal signaling events induced by T-cell stimulation, we show that activation of protein kinase C and activation of Ras are important for the switch toward the exclusion of CD45 variable exons, whereas events related to Ca2+ flux are not. In addition, the ability of cycloheximide to block the activation-induced alternative splicing of CD45 suggests a requirement for de novo protein synthesis. We further demonstrate that sequences which have previously been implicated in the tissue-specific regulation of CD45 variable exons are likewise necessary and sufficient for activation-induced splicing. These results provide an initial understanding of the requirements for CD45 alternative splicing upon T-cell activation, and they confirm the importance of this novel cell line in facilitating a more detailed analysis of the activation-induced regulation of CD45 than has been previously possible.},

Regulation at the level of RNA transcription, splicing, polyadenylation, nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, and translation into polypeptides has been well-studied. Alternative RNA processing events, such as alternative splicing, also have been recognized as key contributors to the complexity of mammalian gene expression. Pre-messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) may be polyadenylated in several different ways due to more than one polyadenylation signal, allowing a single gene to encode multiple mRNA transcripts. However, alternative polyadenylation has only recently taken the field as a major player in gene regulation. This review summarizes what is currently known about alternative polyadenylation. It covers results from bioinformatics, as well as those from investigations of viral and tissue-specific studies and, importantly, will set the stage for what is yet to come.},

By combining siRNA affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we have identified the double-stranded RNA-binding domain protein Blanks to be an siRNA- and dsRNA-binding protein from Drosophila S2 cells. We find that Blanks is a nuclear factor that contributes to the efficiency of RNAi. Biochemical fractionation of a Blanks-containing complex shows that the Blanks complex is unlike previously described RNA-induced silencing complexes and associates with the DEAD-box helicase RM62, a protein previously implicated in RNA silencing. In flies, Blanks is highly expressed in testes tissues and is necessary for postmeiotic spermiogenesis, but loss of Blanks is not accompanied by detectable transposon derepression. Instead, genes related to innate immunity pathways are up-regulated in blanks mutant testes. These results reveal Blanks to be a unique component of a nuclear siRNA/dsRNA-binding complex that contributes to essential RNA silencing-related pathways in the male germ line.},

A number of attempts, which can be comprehensively termed “functional genomics,” are being carried out to decipher which parts of the human genome are transcribed, how the transcripts are spliced and translated, and what functions the eventual protein products conduct. For these purposes, a full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) that contains the entire sequence of the mRNA from the cap structure to the poly(A) tail is a unique resource because a variety of information about the gene functions is contained in a full-length cDNA sequence. The intensive analysis of a full-length cDNA would enable us to identify the following: 1. The exact position of the mRNA transcriptional start site, which is indispensable for the identification of the adjacent promoter. 2. The sequence of the complete 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR), which is related to the translation efficiency and the cellular localization of mRNA. 3. The continuous protein coding region (CDS), which is required for producing a recombinant protein. 4.

Recent advances in data collection and analysis, however, are generating unprecedented amounts of information about gene regulation networks. To understand these complex wiring diagrams, we sought to break down such networks into basic building blocks. We generalize the notion of motifs, widely used for sequence analysis, to the level of networks. We define 'network motifs' as patterns of interconnections that recur in many different parts of a network at frequencies much higher than those found in randomized networks. We applied new algorithms for systematically detecting network motifs to one of the best-characterized regulation networks, that of direct transcriptional interactions in Escherichia coli. We find that much of the network is composed of repeated appearances of three highly significant motifs. Each network motif has a specific function in determining gene expression, such as generating temporal expression programs and governing the responses to fluctuating external signals. The motif structure also allows an easily interpretable view of the entire known transcriptional network of the organism. This approach may help define the basic computational elements of other biological networks.},

@article{Ule2006,
abstract = {Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Laboratory of Molecular Neuro-Oncology, The Rockefeller University, 1230 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA Cognitive function and memory rely on synaptic plasticity — the ability of synapses to modify their strength in response to stimulation. Emerging evidence indicates that post-transcriptional gene regulation is necessary for synaptic plasticity at several levels: by increasing proteome diversity through alternative splicing, or by enabling activity-dependent regulation of mRNA localization, translation or degradation in the dendrite. Mouse knockout studies have linked three RNA-binding proteins, fragile X mental retardation protein, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding factor and neuro-oncological ventral antigen to specific aspects of synaptic plasticity. Specificity in the regulation of synaptic plasticity might, in part, relate to the functional coherence of proteins encoded by the RNA targets of each RNA-binding protein. To store new memory, synapses are modified or created during the process of synaptic plasticity [1 and 2]. Several aspects of synaptic plasticity are mediated in part by transcriptional [1 and 3] and post-transcriptional mechanisms [4]. Here, we review emerging evidence that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play key roles in regulating synaptic plasticity. Upon transcription, RNA passes through several steps in the nucleus and cytoplasm that control its processing, localization, translation and degradation. Each of these steps is regulated by specific RBPs. A recent study found 380 putative RBPs in the mouse genome, 237 of which were detected in brain, and 16 of which showed neuron-specific expression [5]. Little is known about most of these proteins. Because some mRNAs and ribosomes are present in neuronal dendrites, and RNA translation is thought to be essential for some forms of synaptic plasticity, there has been great interest in the possibility that regulation of RNA expression via RBPs might play crucial roles in synaptic plasticity [4, 6 and 7]. To date, the roles of three RNA-binding proteins in synaptic plasticity have been explored in detail. Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) plays a role in metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent long-term depression (LTD) [8 and 9]. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) binding factor (CPEB) is involved in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) [10, 11 and 12] and neuro-oncological ventral antigen (Nova) in NMDA-dependent LTP of slow inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) [13••]. One of the main goals in the studies of RNA regulation in the brain is to understand how regulation of specific mRNA subsets by different RNA-binding proteins contributes to synaptic plasticity. A hypothesis emerging from these studies is that RBPs might regulate biologically coherent subsets of RNAs to mediate synaptic plasticity. Regulation of gene expression in the nucleus plays important roles in synaptic plasticity, as is evident by the finding that transcription is required for the late phase of LTP (L-LTP) [14]. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that alternative splicing (see glossary) can be altered in response to neural activity and play a part in synaptic plasticity. One model for the induction of synaptic plasticity involves simultaneous synaptic stimuli, in which sustained depolarization removes a Mg2+ block from the NMDA receptor, and glutamate binds to the channel to allow Ca2+entry, leading to induction of LTP [15]. There are several instances in which alternative splicing has been linked to neuronal activity and perhaps to synaptic activity. One example comes from analysis of splicing of the NMDA receptor 1 (NR1). Splicing at the alternative 3 splice site of NR1 exon 20 (previously referred to as exon 22; see glossary) is activity dependent, with the proximal 3′ splice site (C2′ variants) predominating upon activity blockade and the distal 3′ splice site (C2 variants) upon increased activity [16]. Splicing of NR1 exon 20 could contribute to the regulation of synaptic plasticity because it affects trafficking of the NMDA receptor from the ER to the synapse [16]. Interestingly, exon 20 is preceded by an alternatively spliced exon 19 (C1 domain), which also regulates NMDAR localization [17], and mediates PKC-dependent phosphorylation [18]. Two other exons that were shown to be regulated in response to activity are the stress axis-regulated exon (STREX) in BK (previously referred to as Slo) potassium channel RNA, which changes the firing properties of the channel [19 and 20], and an exon in Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (Apoer2) that is required for Reelin-dependent enhancement of LTP [21••]. It is generally believed that regulation of neuronal splicing often involves a combination of several RNA-binding proteins, including ubiquitous factors, acting in concert on individual RNAs [22 and 23]. Such combinatorial control could function to enable a small number of RNA-binding proteins to regulate a large number of potential alternative splicing outcomes (or alternative splice site choices) and thereby contribute to the proteomic diversity that is crucial for synaptic function. There are several well-studied examples of combinatorial control of neuronal splicing (see glossary), including the identification of up to six factors that promote neuronal usage of the exon N1 in c-src proto-oncogene mRNA [24 and 25], and several factors involved in the regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor, gamma 2 (GABAR-$\gamma$2) or NMDAR1 exons [26, 27, 28, 29•• and 30•]. In vivo studies have shown that the brain-specific RNA-binding protein Nova2 is crucial for the inclusion of NR1 exon 19, since this exon is inefficiently included in the NR1 mRNA in Nova2−/− forebrain (Figure 1) [29••]. However, Nova2 and Nova1 are not efficient at inducing exon 19 inclusion in the spinal cord, where the exon is predominantly skipped [29••], indicating that either another factor represses inclusion of this exon in the spinal cord or additional factors cooperate with Nova2 in the forebrain. Evidence from minigene assays (see glossary) in cell cultures suggests that the inhibitory action of ubiquitous heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) might be necessary to repress the exon 19 inclusion in the spinal cord (Figure 1) [30•]. In addition, two candidates for cooperative action with Nova in the forebrain are neuroblastoma apoptosis-related RNA-binding protein (NAPOR, also called CUGBP2 or ETR-3), which is predominantly expressed in forebrain [28], and the ubiquitous heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (hnRNP H), both of which promote exon 19 inclusion in cell cultures [30•]. Thus, a combination of ubiquitous (hnRNP A1 and hnRNP H; [31]), forebrain (Napor; [28]) and neuron-specific (Nova; [32 and 33]) RNA-binding proteins might restrict NR1 exon 19 inclusion to the forebrain (Figure 1). The example of NR1 exon 19 clearly shows that even in the context of complex combinatorial control, the absence of a single regulatory protein (Nova2) can cause a large splicing change in vivo (Figure 1). In addition, it suggests that the combinatorial control of NR1 exon 19 might function in a cooperative, rather than additive manner, enabling the change in activity of only one factor to cause a major splicing change. To address this question, we explored the role of a single splicing factor, Nova, using a genome-wide approach. Previous studies identified Nova as a splicing factor regulating neuron-specific alternative splicing of several transcripts [34 and 35]. If Nova regulates exons in an additive way with other factors, then the absence of Nova should generally cause small splicing changes. Alternatively, if Nova regulates exons in a cooperative way with other factors, then large splicing changes would occur in a discrete subset of exons. Analysis of the distribution of splicing changes in Nova1−/− and Nova2−/− mouse brain using a custom Affymetrix splicing microarray (see glossary) [29••] revealed that most exons were unchanged, although a small set showed profound changes (loss of over 50\% of the brain-specific splicing pattern). Statistical analysis supported the conclusion that Nova acts on a small, non-random subset of brain transcripts [29••]. These data show that the loss of Nova activity leads to pronounced splicing changes of a small subset of exons, even though it might be only one of multiple factors regulating splicing of these exons. It is thought that cellular protein networks are composed of functional units, or modules (see glossary) [36 and 37]. The modules encapsulate specific functions and contain the control circuits, composed of both negative and positive feedback, whereby the output is monitored and regulated. Indications of modular post-transcriptional gene regulation were initially offered by studies of sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster [38, 39, 40 and 41] and mammalian translational regulation of iron response element (IRE)-containing mRNAs [42]. In addition, functionally coherent regulatory RNA networks (see glossary) were further suggested from studies in a large variety of systems, including yeast [43 and 44], mammalian tissue-culture cells [45 and 46] and the mouse brain [47, 48 and 49]. Recently, a statistically significant demonstration of a validated functionally coherent RNA network in mammals came from splicing microarray studies [29••]. Analysis of the proteins encoded by validated Nova target RNAs revealed a striking example of modular regulation of gene expression. All of the encoded proteins that had known functions in the brain act either in the synapse (34 out of 40) and/or in axon guidance (8 out of 40). Moreover, of the 35 proteins with known interaction partners, 74\% (26 out of 35) interact with at least one other protein from the same group, suggesting that they form synaptic function},

abstract = {Novel protein-coding genes can arise either through re-organization of pre-existing genes or de novo1, 2. Processes involving re-organization of pre-existing genes, notably after gene duplication, have been extensively described1, 2. In contrast, de novo gene birth remains poorly understood, mainly because translation of sequences devoid of genes, or ‘non-genic’ sequences, is expected to produce insignificant polypeptides rather than proteins with specific biological functions1, 3, 4, 5, 6. Here we formalize an evolutionary model according to which functional genes evolve de novo through transitory proto-genes4 generated by widespread translational activity in non-genic sequences. Testing this model at the genome scale in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we detect translation of hundreds of short species-specific open reading frames (ORFs) located in non-genic sequences. These translation events seem to provide adaptive potential7, as suggested by their differential regulation upon stress and by signatures of retention by natural selection. In line with our model, we establish that S. cerevisiae ORFs can be placed within an evolutionary continuum ranging from non-genic sequences to genes. We identify \~{}1,900 candidate proto-genes among S. cerevisiae ORFs and find that de novo gene birth from such a reservoir may be more prevalent than sporadic gene duplication. Our work illustrates that evolution exploits seemingly dispensable sequences to generate adaptive functional innovation.},

abstract = {Single-stranded DNA molecules (ssDNA) annealed to an RNA splint are notoriously poor substrates for DNA ligases. Herein we report the unexpectedly efficient ligation of RNA-splinted DNA by Chlorella virus DNA ligase (PBCV-1 DNA ligase). PBCV-1 DNA ligase ligated ssDNA splinted by RNA with kcat ≈ 8 x 10(-3) s(-1) and KM < 1 nM at 25°C under conditions where T4 DNA ligase produced only 5'-adenylylated DNA with a 20-fold lower kcat and a KM ≈ 300 nM. The rate of ligation increased with addition of Mn(2+), but was strongly inhibited by concentrations of NaCl >100 mM. Abortive adenylylation was suppressed at low ATP concentrations (<100 µM) and pH >8, leading to increased product yields. The ligation reaction was rapid for a broad range of substrate sequences, but was relatively slower for substrates with a 5'-phosphorylated dC or dG residue on the 3' side of the ligation junction. Nevertheless, PBCV-1 DNA ligase ligated all sequences tested with 10-fold less enzyme and 15-fold shorter incubation times than required when using T4 DNA ligase. Furthermore, this ligase was used in a ligation-based detection assay system to show increased sensitivity over T4 DNA ligase in the specific detection of a target mRNA.},

abstract = {Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays a major role in regulating cell type-specific expression of the protein 4.1 family of skeletal proteins. The biological importance of alternative splicing as a mechanism for 4.1 gene regulation is underscored by studies of the prototypical 4.1R gene in erythroid cells: activation of exon 16 inclusion in mRna at the erythroblast stage greatly enhances the ability of newly synthesized 4.1R protein to bind spectrin and actin, and thus assemble into a stable membrane skeleton. This gain-of- function has profound effects on the biophysical properties of deformability and membrane strength that are critical to red cell survival in the circulation. Another example of developmentally regulated splicing occurs in differentiating mammary epithelial cells in culture, where cell morphogenesis is accompanied by a splicing switch that reversibly activates inclusion of alternative exon muscle. Few other genes are known to be so richly endowed with regulated switches in pre-mRna splicing making the 4.1R gene an interesting paradigm for the role of alternative splicing as a mediator of cell function. Recent evidence that other members of the 4.1 gene family are also regulated by alternative splicing suggests, moreover, that this phenomenon is of general importance in regulating the structure of this class of skeletal proteins.},

abstract = {Neurons are thought to use diverse families of cell-surface molecules for cell recognition during circuit assembly. In Drosophila, alternative splicing of the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) gene potentially generates 38,016 closely related transmembrane proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily, each comprising one of 19,008 alternative ectodomains linked to one of two alternative transmembrane segments. These ectodomains show isoform-specific homophilic binding, leading to speculation that Dscam proteins mediate cell recognition. Genetic studies have established that Dscam is required for neural circuit assembly, but the extent to which isoform diversity contributes to this process is not known. Here we provide conclusive evidence that Dscam diversity is essential for circuit assembly. Using homologous recombination, we reduced the entire repertoire of Dscam ectodomains to just a single isoform. Neural circuits in these mutants are severely disorganized. Furthermore, we show that it is crucial for neighbouring neurons to express distinct isoforms, but that the specific identity of the isoforms expressed in an individual neuron is unimportant. We conclude that Dscam diversity provides each neuron with a unique identity by which it can distinguish its own processes from those of other neurons, and that this self-recognition is essential for wiring the Drosophila brain.},

abstract = {Drosophila Dscam encodes 38,016 distinct axon guidance receptors through the mutually exclusive alternative splicing of 95 variable exons. Importantly, known mechanisms that ensure the mutually exclusive splicing of pairs of exons cannot explain this phenomenon in Dscam. I have identified two classes of conserved elements in the Dscam exon 6 cluster, which contains 48 alternative exons--the docking site, located in the intron downstream of constitutive exon 5, and the selector sequences, which are located upstream of each exon 6 variant. Strikingly, each selector sequence is complementary to a portion of the docking site, and this pairing juxtaposes one, and only one, alternative exon to the upstream constitutive exon. The mutually exclusive nature of the docking site:selector sequence interactions suggests that the formation of these competing RNA structures is a central component of the mechanism guaranteeing that only one exon 6 variant is included in each Dscam mRNA.},

abstract = {Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) have known functions in transposon silencing in the male germline of fetal and newborn mice. Both are also present in adult testes; however, their function here remains a mystery. Here, we confirm that most piRNAs in meiotic spermatocytes originate from clusters in non-repeat intergenic regions of DNA. The regulation of these piRNA clusters, including the processing of the precursor transcripts into individual piRNAs, is accomplished through mostly unknown processes. We present a possible regulatory mechanism for one such cluster, named cluster 1082B, located on chromosome 7 in the mouse genome. The 1082B precursor transcript and its 788 unique piRNAs are repressed by the Alkbh1 dioxygenase and the testis-specific transcription repressor Tzfp. We observe a remarkable >1000-fold upregulation of individual piRNAs in pachytene spermatocytes isolated from Alkbh1- and Tzfp-deficient murine testes. Repression of cluster 1082B is further supported by the identification of a 10-bp Tzfp recognition sequence contained within the precursor transcript. Downregulation of LINE1 and IAP transcripts in the Alkbh1- and Tzfp-deficient mice leads us to propose a potential role for the 1082B-encoded piRNAs in transposon control.},

abstract = {In parallel to the genetic code for protein synthesis, a second layer of information is embedded in all RNA transcripts in the form of RNA structure. RNA structure influences practically every step in the gene expression program. However, the nature of most RNA structures or effects of sequence variation on structure are not known. Here we report the initial landscape and variation of RNA secondary structures (RSSs) in a human family trio (mother, father and their child). This provides a comprehensive RSS map of human coding and non-coding RNAs. We identify unique RSS signatures that demarcate open reading frames and splicing junctions, and define authentic microRNA-binding sites. Comparison of native deproteinized RNA isolated from cells versus refolded purified RNA suggests that the majority of the RSS information is encoded within RNA sequence. Over 1,900 transcribed single nucleotide variants (approximately 15\% of all transcribed single nucleotide variants) alter local RNA structure. We discover simple sequence and spacing rules that determine the ability of point mutations to impact RSSs. Selective depletion of 'riboSNitches' versus structurally synonymous variants at precise locations suggests selection for specific RNA shapes at thousands of sites, including 3' untranslated regions, binding sites of microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins genome-wide. These results highlight the potentially broad contribution of RNA structure and its variation to gene regulation.},

abstract = {The Piwi protein subfamily is essential for Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) biogenesis, transposon silencing, and germ-line development, all of which have been proposed to require Piwi endonuclease activity, as validated for two cytoplasmic Piwi proteins in mice. However, recent evidence has led to questioning of the generality of this mechanism for the Piwi members that reside in the nucleus. Drosophila offers a distinct opportunity to study the function of nuclear Piwi proteins because, among three Drosophila Piwi proteins-called Piwi, Aubergine, and Argonaute 3-Piwi is the only member of this subfamily that is localized in the nucleus and expressed in both germ-line and somatic cells in the gonad, where it is responsible for piRNA biogenesis and regulatory functions essential for fertility. In this study, we demonstrate beyond doubt that the slicer activity of Piwi is not required for any known functions in vivo. We show that, in transgenic flies with the DDX catalytic triad of PIWI mutated, neither primary nor secondary piRNA biogenesis is detectably affected, transposons remain repressed, and fertility is normal. Our observations demonstrate that the mechanism of Piwi is independent of its in vitro endonuclease activity. Instead, it is consistent with the alternative mode of Piwi function as a molecule involved in the piRNA-directed guidance of epigenetic factors to chromatin.},

abstract = {Smg1 is a PI3K-related kinase (PIKK) associated with multiple cellular functions, including DNA damage responses, telomere maintenance, and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). NMD degrades transcripts that harbor premature termination codons (PTCs) as a result of events such as mutation or alternative splicing (AS). Recognition of PTCs during NMD requires the action of the Upstream frameshift protein Upf1, which must first be phosphorylated by Smg1. However, the physiological function of mammalian Smg1 is not known. By using a gene-trap model of Smg1 deficiency, we show that this kinase is essential for mouse embryogenesis such that Smg1 loss is lethal at embryonic day 8.5. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of RNA from cells of Smg1-deficient embryos revealed that Smg1 depletion led to pronounced accumulation of PTC-containing splice variant transcripts from approximately 9\% of genes predicted to contain AS events capable of eliciting NMD. Among these genes are those involved in splicing itself, as well as genes not previously known to be subject to AS-coupled NMD, including several involved in transcription, intracellular signaling, membrane dynamics, cell death, and metabolism. Our results demonstrate a critical role for Smg1 in early mouse development and link the loss of this NMD factor to major and widespread changes in the mammalian transcriptome.},

abstract = {In honey bees (Apis mellifera) the behaviorally and reproductively distinct queen and worker female castes derive from the same genome as a result of differential intake of royal jelly and are implemented in concert with DNA methylation. To determine if these very different diet-controlled phenotypes correlate with unique brain methylomes, we conducted a study to determine the methyl cytosine (mC) distribution in the brains of queens and workers at single-base-pair resolution using shotgun bisulfite sequencing technology. The whole-genome sequencing was validated by deep 454 sequencing of selected amplicons representing eight methylated genes. We found that nearly all mCs are located in CpG dinucleotides in the exons of 5,854 genes showing greater sequence conservation than non-methylated genes. Over 550 genes show significant methylation differences between queens and workers, revealing the intricate dynamics of methylation patterns. The distinctiveness of the differentially methylated genes is underscored by their intermediate CpG densities relative to drastically CpG-depleted methylated genes and to CpG-richer non-methylated genes. We find a strong correlation between methylation patterns and splicing sites including those that have the potential to generate alternative exons. We validate our genome-wide analyses by a detailed examination of two transcript variants encoded by one of the differentially methylated genes. The link between methylation and splicing is further supported by the differential methylation of genes belonging to the histone gene family. We propose that modulation of alternative splicing is one mechanism by which DNA methylation could be linked to gene regulation in the honey bee. Our study describes a level of molecular diversity previously unknown in honey bees that might be important for generating phenotypic flexibility not only during development but also in the adult post-mitotic brain.},

abstract = {The identification of untranslated regions, introns, and coding regions within an organism remains challenging. We developed a quantitative sequencing-based method called RNA-Seq for mapping transcribed regions, in which complementary DNA fragments are subjected to high-throughput sequencing and mapped to the genome. We applied RNA-Seq to generate a high-resolution transcriptome map of the yeast genome and demonstrated that most (74.5\%) of the nonrepetitive sequence of the yeast genome is transcribed. We confirmed many known and predicted introns and demonstrated that others are not actively used. Alternative initiation codons and upstream open reading frames also were identified for many yeast genes. We also found unexpected 3'-end heterogeneity and the presence of many overlapping genes. These results indicate that the yeast transcriptome is more complex than previously appreciated.},

abstract = {Recent findings justify a renewed interest in alternative splicing (AS): the process is more a rule than an exception as it affects the expression of 60\% of human genes; it explains how a vast mammalian proteomic complexity is achieved with a limited number of genes; and mutations in AS regulatory sequences are a widespread source of human disease. AS regulation not only depends on the interaction of splicing factors with their target sequences in the pre-mRNA but is coupled to transcription. A clearer picture is emerging of the mechanisms by which transcription affects AS through promoter identity and occupation. These mechanisms involve the recruitment of factors with dual functions in transcription and splicing (i.e. that contain both functional domains and hence link the two processes) and the control of RNA polymerase II elongation.},

Yet, like microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, such species guide Argonaute proteins to silencing targets through complementary base-pairing. Silencing can be achieved by corecruitment of accessory factors or through the activity of Argonaute itself, which often has endonucleolytic activity.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Alternative splicing expands transcriptome diversity and plays an important role in regulation of gene expression. Previous studies focus on the regulation of a single cassette exon, but recent experiments indicate that multiple cassette exons within a gene may interact with each other. This interaction can increase the potential to generate various transcripts and adds an extra layer of complexity to gene regulation. Several cases of exon interaction have been discovered. However, the extent to which the cassette exons coordinate with each other remains unknown.RESULTS:Based on EST data, we employed a metric of correlation coefficients to describe the interaction between two adjacent cassette exons and then categorized these exon pairs into three different groups by their interaction (correlation) patterns. Sequence analysis demonstrates that strongly-correlated groups are more conserved and contain a higher proportion of pairs with reading frame preservation in a combinatorial manner. Multiple genome comparison further indicates that different groups of correlated pairs have different evolutionary courses: (1) The vast majority of positively-correlated pairs are old, (2) most of the weakly-correlated pairs are relatively young, and (3) negatively-correlated pairs are a mixture of old and young events.CONCLUSION:We performed a large-scale analysis of interactions between adjacent cassette exons. Compared with weakly-correlated pairs, the strongly-correlated pairs, including both the positively and negatively correlated ones, show more evidence that they are under delicate splicing control and tend to be functionally important. Additionally, the positively-correlated pairs bear strong resemblance to constitutive exons, which suggests that they may evolve from ancient constitutive exons, while negatively and weakly correlated pairs are more likely to contain newly emerging exons.},

We systematically analysed the Drosophila TUDOR protein family and identified four previously not characterized TUDOR domain-containing proteins (CG4771, CG14303, CG11133 and CG31755) as essential piRNA pathway factors. We characterized CG4771 (Vreteno) in detail and demonstrate a critical role for this protein in primary piRNA biogenesis. Vreteno physically and/or genetically interacts with the primary pathway components Piwi, Armitage, Yb and Zucchini. Vreteno also interacts with the Tdrd12 orthologues CG11133 (Brother of Yb) and CG31755 (Sister of Yb), which are essential for the primary piRNA pathway in the germline and probably replace the function of the related but soma-specific factor Yb.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs are endogenous non-coding RNAs which negatively regulate the expression of protein-coding genes in plants and animals. They are known to play an important role in several biological processes and, together with transcription factors, form a complex and highly interconnected regulatory network. Looking at the structure of this network, it is possible to recognize a few overrepresented motifs which are expected to perform important elementary regulatory functions. Among them, a special role is played by the microRNA-mediated feedforward loop in which a master transcription factor regulates a microRNA and, together with it, a set of target genes. In this paper we show analytically and through simulations that the incoherent version of this motif can couple the fine-tuning of a target protein level with an efficient noise control, thus conferring precision and stability to the overall gene expression program, especially in the presence of fluctuations in upstream regulators. Among the other results, a nontrivial prediction of our model is that the optimal attenuation of fluctuations coincides with a modest repression of the target expression. This feature is coherent with the expected fine-tuning function and in agreement with experimental observations of the actual impact of a wide class of microRNAs on the protein output of their targets. Finally, we describe the impact on noise-buffering efficiency of the cross-talk between microRNA targets that can naturally arise if the microRNA-mediated circuit is not considered as isolated, but embedded in a larger network of regulations.},

June 27, 1970 was a significant day for our understanding of both the flow of information in biological systems and the evolution of eukaryotic genomes as this was the day that Nature published back-to-back papers reporting the discovery of an enzyme that copies RNA into DNA. This soon became known as reverse transcriptase and the RNA tumour viruses in which it was detected were renamed retroviruses. The realisation that retroviruses can convert their genomic RNA into DNA provided a route by which they could integrate into the chromosomes of infected cells as Howard Temin and his colleagues had proposed some years earlier. At the time it was thought that the ability to copy RNA into DNA would be confined to retroviruses. One of the more startling outcomes of whole genome DNA sequencing has been the discovery that eukaryotes can have more reverse transcriptase genes than genes coding for any other protein, and that the largest single component of many eukaryotic genomes has been generated by reverse transcription.},

A retrotransposon sequence within a noncoding RNA spanning the DMR was targeted by piRNAs generated from a different locus. A direct repeat in the DMR, which is required for the methylation and imprinting of Rasgrf1, served as a promoter for this RNA.

abstract = {INTRODUCTION
Perhaps the most important and certainly the most often used technique in RNA analysis is gel electrophoresis. This technique is generally applicable for RNA detection, quantification, purification by size, and quality assessment. Because RNAs are negatively charged, they migrate toward the anode in the presence of electric current. The gel acts as a sieve to selectively impede the migration of the RNA in proportion to its mass, given that its mass is generally proportional to its charge. Because mass is approximately related to chain length, the length of an RNA is more generally determined by its migration. In addition, topology (i.e., circularity) can affect migration, making RNAs appear longer on the gel than they actually are. Gels are used in a wide variety of techniques, including Northern blotting, primer extension, footprinting, and analyzing processing reactions. They are invaluable as preparative and fractionating tools. There are two common types of gel: polyacrylamide and agarose. For most applications, denaturing acrylamide gels are most appropriate. These gels are extremely versatile and can resolve RNAs from \~{}600 to ≤20 nucleotides (nt). In certain circumstances, e.g., resolving different conformers of RNAs or RNA-protein complexes, native gels are appropriate. The only disadvantage to acrylamide gels is that they are not suitable for analyzing large RNAs (≥600 nt); for such applications, agarose gels are preferred. This protocol describes how to prepare, load, and run polyacrylamide gels for RNA analysis.},

abstract = {<p>Summary<br/>RNA transcripts are subject to posttranscriptional gene regulation involving hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNA-containing ribonucleoprotein complexes (miRNPs) expressed in a cell-type dependent fashion. We developed a cell-based crosslinking approach to determine at high resolution and transcriptome-wide the binding sites of cellular RBPs and miRNPs. The crosslinked sites are revealed by thymidine to cytidine transitions in the cDNAs prepared from immunopurified RNPs of 4-thiouridine-treated cells. We determined the binding sites and regulatory consequences for several intensely studied RBPs and miRNPs, including PUM2, QKI, IGF2BP1-3, AGO/EIF2C1-4 and TNRC6A-C. Our study revealed that these factors bind thousands of sites containing defined sequence motifs and have distinct preferences for exonic versus intronic or coding versus untranslated transcript regions. The precise mapping of binding sites across the transcriptome will be critical to the interpretation of the rapidly emerging data on genetic variation between individuals and how these variations contribute to complex genetic diseases.</p>},

abstract = {The genome of bacteriophage T4 encodes three polynucleotide ligases, which seal the backbone of nucleic acids during infection of host bacteria. The T4Dnl (T4 DNA ligase) and two RNA ligases [T4Rnl1 (T4 RNA ligase 1) and T4Rnl2] join a diverse array of substrates, including nicks that are present in double-stranded nucleic acids, albeit with different efficiencies. To unravel the biochemical and functional relationship between these proteins, a systematic analysis of their substrate specificity was performed using recombinant proteins. The ability of each protein to ligate 20 bp double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a single-strand break was determined. Between 4 and 37 °C, all proteins ligated substrates containing various combinations of DNA and RNA. The RNA ligases ligated a more diverse set of substrates than T4Dnl and, generally, T4Rnl1 had 50–1000-fold lower activity than T4Rnl2. In assays using identical conditions, optimal ligation of all substrates was at pH 8 for T4Dnl and T4Rnl1 and pH 7 for T4Rnl2, demonstrating that the protein dictates the pH optimum for ligation. All proteins ligated a substrate containing DNA as the unbroken strand, with the nucleotides at the nick of the broken strand being RNA at the 3′-hydroxy group and DNA at the 5′-phosphate. Since this RNA–DNA hybrid was joined at a similar maximal rate by T4Dnl and T4Rnl2 at 37 °C, we consider the possibility that this could be an unexpected physiological substrate used during some pathways of ‘DNA repair’.},

We detected the temporal order of their enzymatic incorporation into a growing DNA strand with zero-mode waveguide nanostructure arrays, which provide optical observation volume confinement and enable parallel, simultaneous detection of thousands of single-molecule sequencing reactions. Conjugation of fluorophores to the terminal phosphate moiety of the dNTPs allows continuous observation of DNA synthesis over thousands of bases without steric hindrance. The data report directly on polymerase dynamics, revealing distinct polymerization states and pause sites corresponding to DNA secondary structure. Sequence data were aligned with the known reference sequence to assay biophysical parameters of polymerization for each template position. Consensus sequences were generated from the single-molecule reads at 15-fold coverage, showing a median accuracy of 99.3\%, with no systematic error beyond fluorophore-dependent error rates.},

abstract = {Motivation: Measurement precision determines the power of any analysis to reliably identify significant signals, such as in screens for differential expression, independent of whether the experimental design incorporates replicates or not. With the compilation of large-scale RNA-Seq datasets with technical replicate samples, however, we can now, for the first time, perform a systematic analysis of the precision of expression level estimates from massively parallel sequencing technology. This then allows considerations for its improvement by computational or experimental means.
Results: We report on a comprehensive study of target identification and measurement precision, including their dependence on transcript expression levels, read depth and other parameters. In particular, an impressive recall of 84\% of the estimated true transcript population could be achieved with 331 million 50 bp reads, with diminishing returns from longer read lengths and even less gains from increased sequencing depths. Most of the measurement power (75\%) is spent on only 7\% of the known transcriptome, however, making less strongly expressed transcripts harder to measure. Consequently, <30\% of all transcripts could be quantified reliably with a relative error <20\%. Based on established tools, we then introduce a new approach for mapping and analysing sequencing reads that yields substantially improved performance in gene expression profiling, increasing the number of transcripts that can reliably be quantified to over 40\%. Extrapolations to higher sequencing depths highlight the need for efficient complementary steps. In discussion we outline possible experimental and computational strategies for further improvements in quantification precision.

@article{Lehman1974,
abstract = {DNA ligase of E. coli is a polypeptide of molecular weight 75,000. The comparable T4-induced enzyme is somewhat smaller (63,000 to 68,000). Both enzymes catalyze the synthesis of phosphodiester bonds between adjacent 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl groups in nicked duplex DNA, coupled to the cleavage of the pyrophosphate bond of DPN (E. coli) or ATP (T4). Phosphodiester bond synthesis catalyzed by both enzymes occurs in a series of these discrete steps and involves the participation of two covalent intermediates (Fig. 1). A steady state kinetic analysis of the reaction-catalyzed E. coli ligase supports this mechanism, and further demonstrates that enzyme-adenylate and DNA-adenylate are kinetically significant intermediates on the direct path of phosphodiester bond synthesis. A strain of E. coli with a mutation in the structural gene for DNA ligase which results in the synthesis of an abnormally thermolabile enzyme is inviable at 42 degrees C. Although able to grow at 30 degrees C, the mutant is still defective at this temperature in its ability to repair damage to its DNA caused by ultraviolet irradiation and by alkylating agents. At 42 degrees C, all the newly replicated DNA is in the form of short 10S "Okazaki fragments," an indication that the reason for the mutant's failure to survive under these conditions is its inability to sustain the ligation step that is essential for the discontinuous synthesis of the E. coli chromosome. DNA ligase is therefore an essential enzyme required for normal DNA replication and repair in E. coli. Purified DNA ligases have proved to be useful reagents in the construction in vitro of recombinant DNA molecules.},

abstract = {Drosophila Piwi-family proteins have been implicated in transposon control. Here, we examine piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) associated with each Drosophila Piwi protein and find that Piwi and Aubergine bind RNAs that are predominantly antisense to transposons, whereas Ago3 complexes contain predominantly sense piRNAs. As in mammals, the majority of Drosophila piRNAs are derived from discrete genomic loci. These loci comprise mainly defective transposon sequences, and some have previously been identified as master regulators of transposon activity. Our data suggest that heterochromatic piRNA loci interact with potentially active, euchromatic transposons to form an adaptive system for transposon control. Complementary relationships between sense and antisense piRNA populations suggest an amplification loop wherein each piRNA-directed cleavage event generates the 5' end of a new piRNA. Thus, sense piRNAs, formed following cleavage of transposon mRNAs may enhance production of antisense piRNAs, complementary to active elements, by directing cleavage of transcripts from master control loci.},

abstract = {The spatial organization of the genome is intimately linked to its biological function, yet our understanding of higher order genomic structure is coarse, fragmented and incomplete. In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories1. These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide2. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term ‘topological domains’, as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.},

abstract = {The biological consequences of steroid hormone-mediated transcriptional activation of target genes might be difficult to predict because alternative splicing of a single neosynthesized precursor RNA can result in production of different protein isoforms with opposite biological activities. Therefore, an important question to address is the manner in which steroid hormones affect the splicing of their target gene transcripts. In this report, we demonstrate that individual steroid hormones had different and opposite effects on alternative splicing decisions, stimulating the production of different spliced variants produced from genes driven by steroid hormone-dependent promoters. Steroid hormone transcriptional effects are mediated by steroid hormone receptor coregulators that also modify alternative splicing decisions. Our data suggest that activated steroid hormone receptors recruit coregulators to the target promoter that participate in both the production and the splicing of the target gene transcripts. Because different coregulators activating transcription can have opposite effects on alternative splicing decisions, we conclude that the precise nature of the transcriptional coregulators recruited by activated steroid receptors, depending on the promoter and cellular contexts, may play a major role in regulating the nature of the spliced variants produced from certain target genes in response to steroid hormones.},

Alternative splicing potentially generates 38,016 isoforms differing in their extracellular Ig and transmembrane domains. We demonstrate that Dscam mediates the sorting of axons in the developing mushroom body (MB). This correlates with the precise spatiotemporal pattern of Dscam protein expression. We demonstrate that MB neurons express different arrays of Dscam isoforms and that single MB neurons express multiple isoforms. Two different Dscam isoforms differing in their extracellular domains introduced as transgenes into single mutant cells partially rescued the mutant phenotype. Expression of one isoform of Dscam in a cohort of MB neurons induced dominant phenotypes, while expression of a single isoform in a single cell did not. We propose that different extracellular domains of Dscam share a common function and that differences in isoforms expressed on the surface of neighboring axons influence interactions between them.},

abstract = {Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs expressed in the animal gonads. They are implicated in silencing the genome instability threat posed by mobile genetic elements called transposons. Unlike other small RNAs, which use double-stranded precursors, piRNAs seem to arise from long single-stranded precursor transcripts expressed from discrete genomic regions. In mice, the Piwi pathway is essential for male fertility, and its loss-of-function mutations affect several distinct stages of spermatogenesis. While this small RNA pathway primarily operates post-transcriptionally, it also impacts DNA methylation of target retrotransposon loci, representing an intriguing model of RNA-directed epigenetic control in mammals. Remarkably the Piwi pathway components are specifically localized at germinal granule/nuage, an evolutionarily conserved but still enigmatic ribonucleoprotein compartment in the germline. The inaccessibility of the germline for easy experimental manipulation has meant that this class of RNAs has remained enigmatic. However, recent advances in the use of cell culture models and cell-free systems have greatly advanced our understanding. In this review, we briefly summarize our current understanding of the Piwi pathway, focusing on its developmental regulation, piRNA biogenesis and key function in male germline development from fetal spermatogonial stem cell stage to postnatal haploid spermiogenesis in mice.},

We recommend approximating short sequence motif distributions with the maximum entropy distribution (MED) consistent with low-order marginal constraints estimated from available data, which may include dependencies between nonadjacent as well as adjacent positions. Many maximum entropy models (MEMs) are specified by simply changing the set of constraints. Such models can be utilized to discriminate between signals and decoys. Classification performance using different MEMs gives insight into the relative importance of dependencies between different positions. We apply our framework to large datasets of RNA splicing signals. Our best models out-perform previous probabilistic models in the discrimination of human 5' (donor) and 3' (acceptor) splice sites from decoys. Finally, we discuss mechanistically motivated ways of comparing models.},

We have developed an optical tweezers assay to follow individual Pol II complexes as they transcribe nucleosomal DNA. Our results indicate that the nucleosome behaves as a fluctuating barrier that locally increases pause density, slows pause recovery, and reduces the apparent pause-free velocity of Pol II. The polymerase, rather than actively separating DNA from histones, functions instead as a ratchet that rectifies nucleosomal fluctuations. We also obtained direct evidence that transcription through a nucleosome involves transfer of the core histones behind the transcribing polymerase via a transient DNA loop. The interplay between polymerase dynamics and nucleosome fluctuations provides a physical basis for the regulation of eukaryotic transcription.},

MACS consists of four steps: removing redundant reads, adjusting read position, calculating peak enrichment and estimating the empirical false discovery rate (FDR). In this protocol, we provide a detailed demonstration of how to install MACS and how to use it to analyze three common types of ChIP-seq data sets with different characteristics: the sequence-specific transcription factor FoxA1, the histone modification mark H3K4me3 with sharp enrichment and the H3K36me3 mark with broad enrichment. We also explain how to interpret and visualize the results of MACS analyses.

abstract = {In mammals, germ cells derive from the pluripotent cells that are present early in embryogenesis, and then differentiate into male sperm or female eggs as development proceeds. Fusion between an egg and a sperm at fertilization allows genetic information from both parents to be transmitted to the next generation, and produces a pluripotent zygote to initiate the next round of embryogenesis. Meiosis is a central event in this self-perpetuating cycle that creates genetic diversity by generating new combinations of existing genetic alleles, and halves the number of chromosomes in the developing male and female germ cells to allow chromosome number to be maintained through successive generations. The developing germ cells also help to maintain genetic and chromosomal stability through the generations by protecting the genome from excessive de novo mutation. Several mouse mutants have recently been characterised whose germ cells exhibit defects in silencing the potentially mutagenic endogenous retroviruses and other retrotransposons that are prevalent in mammalian genomes, and these germ cells also exhibit defects in progression through meiosis. Here we review how mouse germ cells develop and proceed through meiosis, how mouse germ cells silence endogenous retroviruses and other retrotransposons, and discuss why silencing of endogenous retroviruses and other retrotransposons may be required for meiotic progression in mice.},

abstract = {The Drosophila melanogaster Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) gene encodes an axon guidance receptor that can express 38,016 different mRNAs by virtue of alternative splicing. The Dscam gene contains 95 alternative exons that are organized into four clusters of 12, 48, 33, and 2 exons each. Although numerous Dscam mRNA isoforms can be synthesized, it remains to be determined whether different Dscam isoforms are synthesized at different times in development or in different tissues. We have investigated the alternative splicing of the Dscam exon 4 cluster, which contains 12 mutually exclusive alternative exons, and found that Dscam exon 4 alternative splicing is developmentally regulated. The most highly regulated exon, 4.2, is infrequently used in early embryos but is the predominant exon 4 variant used in adults. Moreover, the developmental regulation of exon 4.2 alternative splicing is conserved in D. yakuba. In addition, different adult tissues express distinct collections of Dscam mRNA isoforms. Given the role of Dscam in neural development, these results suggest that the regulation of alternative splicing plays an important role in determining the specificity of neuronal wiring. In addition, this work provides a framework to determine the mechanisms by which complex alternative splicing events are regulated.},

abstract = {CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a DNA-binding protein that plays important roles in chromatin organization, although the mechanism by which CTCF carries out these functions is not fully understood. Recent studies show that CTCF recruits the cohesin complex to insulator sites and that cohesin is required for insulator activity. Here we showed that the DEAD-box RNA helicase p68 (DDX5) and its associated noncoding RNA, steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA), form a complex with CTCF that is essential for insulator function. p68 was detected at CTCF sites in the IGF2/H19 imprinted control region (ICR) as well as other genomic CTCF sites. In vivo depletion of SRA or p68 reduced CTCF-mediated insulator activity at the IGF2/H19 ICR, increased levels of IGF2 expression, and increased interactions between the endodermal enhancer and IGF2 promoter. p68/SRA also interacts with members of the cohesin complex. Depletion of either p68 or SRA does not affect CTCF binding to its genomic sites, but does reduce cohesin binding. The results suggest that p68/SRA stabilizes the interaction of cohesin with CTCF by binding to both, and is required for proper insulator function.},

@article{Rehrauer2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA-seq is now widely used to quantitatively assess gene expression, expression differences and isoform switching, and promises to deliver results for the entire transcriptome. However, whether the transcriptional state of a gene can be captured accurately depends critically on library preparation, read alignment, expression estimation and the tests for differential expression and isoform switching. There are comparisons available for the individual steps but there is not yet a systematic investigation which specific genes are impacted by biases throughout the entire analysis workflow. It is especially unclear whether for a given gene, with current methods and protocols, expression changes and isoform switches can be detected.

RESULTS: For the human genes, we report their detectability under various conditions using different approaches. Overall, we find that the input material has the biggest influence and may, depending on the protocol and RNA degradation, exhibit already strong length-dependent over- and underrepresentation of transcripts. The alignment step aligns for 50\% of the isoforms up to 99\% of the reads correctly; only in the presence of transcript modifications mainly short isoforms will have a low alignment rate. In our dataset, we found that, depending on the aligner and the input material used, the expression estimation of up to 93\% of the genes being accurate within a factor of two; with the deviations being due to ambiguous alignments. Detection of differential expression using a negative-binomial count model works reliably for our simulated data but is dependent on the count accuracy. Interestingly, using the fold-change instead of the p-value as a score for differential expression yields the same performance in the situation of three replicates and the true change being two-fold. Isoform switching is harder to detect and for at least 109 genes the isoform differences evade detection independent of the method used.

CONCLUSIONS: RNA-seq is a reliable tool but the repetitive nature of the human genome makes the origin of the reads ambiguous and limits the detectability for certain genes. RNA-seq does not equally well represent isoforms independent of their size which may range from \~{}200nt to \~{}100'000nt. Researchers are advised to verify that their target genes do not have extreme properties with respect to repeated regions, GC content, and isoform length and complexity.},

@article{badiscotranscriptome2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) displays a fascinating type of phenotypic plasticity, designated as 'phase polyphenism'. Depending on environmental conditions, one genome can be translated into two highly divergent phenotypes, termed the solitarious and gregarious (swarming) phase. Although many of the underlying molecular events remain elusive, the central nervous system (CNS) is expected to play a crucial role in the phase transition process. Locusts have also proven to be interesting model organisms in a physiological and neurobiological research context. However, molecular studies in locusts are hampered by the fact that genome/transcriptome sequence information available for this branch of insects is still limited. METHODOLOGY: We have generated 34,672 raw expressed sequence tags (EST) from the CNS of desert locusts in both phases. These ESTs were assembled in 12,709 unique transcript sequences and nearly 4,000 sequences were functionally annotated. Moreover, the obtained S. gregaria EST information is highly complementary to the existing orthopteran transcriptomic data. Since many novel transcripts encode neuronal signaling and signal transduction components, this paper includes an overview of these sequences. Furthermore, several transcripts being differentially represented in solitarious and gregarious locusts were retrieved from this EST database. The findings highlight the involvement of the CNS in the phase transition process and indicate that this novel annotated database may also add to the emerging knowledge of concomitant neuronal signaling and neuroplasticity events. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we met the need for novel sequence data from desert locust CNS. To our knowledge, we hereby also present the first insect EST database that is derived from the complete CNS. The obtained S. gregaria EST data constitute an important new source of information that will be instrumental in further unraveling the molecular principles of phase polyphenism, in further establishing locusts as valuable research model organisms and in molecular evolutionary and comparative entomology.},

abstract = {In recent years, genome-wide detection of alternative splicing based on Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequence alignments with mRNA and genomic sequences has dramatically expanded our understanding of the role of alternative splicing in functional regulation. This chapter reviews the data, methodology, and technical challenges of these genome-wide analyses of alternative splicing, and briefly surveys some of the uses to which such alternative splicing databases have been put. For example, with proper alterna- tive splicing database schema design, it is possible to query genome-wide for alternative splicing patterns that are specific to particular tissues, disease states (e.g., cancer), gender, or developmental stages. EST alignments can be used to estimate exon inclusion or exclusion level of alternatively spliced exons and evolutionary changes for various species can be inferred from exon inclusion level. Such databases can also help automate design of probes for RT-PCR and microarrays, enabling high throughput experimental measurement of alternative splicing.},

Genetic studies revealed that Dscam, Dock and Pak, a serine/threonine kinase, act together to direct pathfinding of Bolwig's nerve, containing a subclass of sensory axons, to an intermediate target in the embryo. Dscam also is required for the formation of axon pathways in the embryonic central nervous system. cDNA and genomic analyses reveal the existence of multiple forms of Dscam with a conserved architecture containing variable Ig and transmembrane domains. Alternative splicing can potentially generate more than 38,000 Dscam isoforms. This molecular diversity may contribute to the specificity of neuronal connectivity.},

To investigate the functional relevance of lncRNAs in various physiological conditions, we have developed a collection of 18 lncRNA knockout strains in which the locus is maintained transcriptionally active. Initial characterization revealed peri- and postnatal lethal phenotypes in three mutant strains (Fendrr, Peril, and Mdgt), the latter two exhibiting incomplete penetrance and growth defects in survivors. We also report growth defects for two additional mutant strains (linc-Brn1b and linc-Pint). Further analysis revealed defects in lung, gastrointestinal tract, and heart in Fendrr(-/-) neonates, whereas linc-Brn1b(-/-) mutants displayed distinct abnormalities in the generation of upper layer II-IV neurons in the neocortex. This study demonstrates that lncRNAs play critical roles in vivo and provides a framework and impetus for future larger-scale functional investigation into the roles of lncRNA molecules.

@article{Modrek2001,
abstract = {We have identified 6201 alternative splice relationships in human genes, through a genome-wide analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Starting with approximately 2.1 million human mRNA and EST sequences, we mapped expressed sequences onto the draft human genome sequence and only accepted splices that obeyed the standard splice site consensus. A large fraction (47\%) of these were observed multiple times, indicating that they comprise a substantial fraction of the mRNA species. The vast majority of the detected alternative forms appear to be novel, and produce highly specific, biologically meaningful control of function in both known and novel human genes, e.g. specific removal of the lysosomal targeting signal from HLA-DM beta chain, replacement of the C-terminal transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail in an FC receptor beta chain homolog with a different transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail, likely modulating its signal transduction activity. Our data indicate that a large proportion of human genes, probably 42\% or more, are alternatively spliced, but that this appears to be observed mainly in certain types of molecules (e.g. cell surface receptors) and systemic functions, particularly the immune system and nervous system. These results provide a comprehensive dataset for understanding the role of alternative splicing in the human genome, accessible at http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/HASDB.},

abstract = {Mutations generate sequence diversity and provide a substrate for selection. The rate of de novo mutations is therefore of major importance to evolution. Here we conduct a study of genome-wide mutation rates by sequencing the entire genomes of 78 Icelandic parent–offspring trios at high coverage. We show that in our samples, with an average father’s age of 29.7, the average de novo mutation rate is 1.20 × 10−8 per nucleotide per generation. Most notably, the diversity in mutation rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms is dominated by the age of the father at conception of the child. The effect is an increase of about two mutations per year. An exponential model estimates paternal mutations doubling every 16.5 years. After accounting for random Poisson variation, father’s age is estimated to explain nearly all of the remaining variation in the de novo mutation counts. These observations shed light on the importance of the father’s age on the risk of diseases such as schizophrenia and autism.},

@article{Howald2012,
abstract = {Within the ENCODE Consortium, GENCODE aimed to accurately annotate all protein-coding genes, pseudogenes, and noncoding transcribed loci in the human genome through manual curation and computational methods. Annotated transcript structures were assessed, and less well-supported loci were systematically, experimentally validated. Predicted exon-exon junctions were evaluated by RT-PCR amplification followed by highly multiplexed sequencing readout, a method we called RT-PCR-seq. Seventy-nine percent of all assessed junctions are confirmed by this evaluation procedure, demonstrating the high quality of the GENCODE gene set. RT-PCR-seq was also efficient to screen gene models predicted using the Human Body Map (HBM) RNA-seq data. We validated 73\% of these predictions, thus confirming 1168 novel genes, mostly noncoding, which will further complement the GENCODE annotation. Our novel experimental validation pipeline is extremely sensitive, far more than unbiased transcriptome profiling through RNA sequencing, which is becoming the norm. For example, exon-exon junctions unique to GENCODE annotated transcripts are five times more likely to be corroborated with our targeted approach than with extensive large human transcriptome profiling. Data sets such as the HBM and ENCODE RNA-seq data fail sampling of low-expressed transcripts. Our RT-PCR-seq targeted approach also has the advantage of identifying novel exons of known genes, as we discovered unannotated exons in \~{}11\% of assessed introns. We thus estimate that at least 18\% of known loci have yet-unannotated exons. Our work demonstrates that the cataloging of all of the genic elements encoded in the human genome will necessitate a coordinated effort between unbiased and targeted approaches, like RNA-seq and RT-PCR-seq.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION

Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner.


RESULTS

This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: BEDTools was written in C++. Source code and a comprehensive user manual are freely available at http://code.google.com/p/bedtools

abstract = {mRNA polyadenylation is responsible for the 3′ end formation of most mRNAs in eukaryotic cells and is linked to termination of transcription. Prediction of mRNA polyadenylation sites [poly(A) sites] can help identify genes, define gene boundaries, and elucidate regulatory mechanisms. Current methods for poly(A) site prediction achieve moderate sensitivity and specificity. Here, we present a method using support vector machine for poly(A) site prediction. Using 15 cis-regulatory elements that are over-represented in various regions surrounding poly(A) sites, this method achieves higher sensitivity and similar specificity when compared with polyadq, a common tool for poly(A) site prediction. In addition, we found that while the polyadenylation signal AAUAAA and U-rich elements are primary determinants for poly(A) site prediction, other elements contribute to both sensitivity and specificity of the prediction, indicating a combinatorial mechanism involving multiple elements when choosing poly(A) sites in human cells.

@article{Ipsaro2012,
abstract = {PIWI-family proteins and their associated small RNAs (piRNAs) act in an evolutionarily conserved innate immune mechanism to provide essential protection for germ-cell genomes against the activity of mobile genetic elements. piRNA populations comprise a molecular definition of transposons, which permits them to distinguish transposons from host genes and selectively silence them. piRNAs can be generated in two distinct ways, forming either primary or secondary piRNAs. Primary piRNAs come from discrete genomic loci, termed piRNA clusters, and seem to be derived from long, single-stranded precursors. The biogenesis of primary piRNAs involves at least two nucleolytic steps. An unknown enzyme cleaves piRNA cluster transcripts to generate monophosphorylated piRNA 5' ends. piRNA 3' ends are probably formed by exonucleolytic trimming, after a piRNA precursor is loaded into its PIWI partner. Secondary piRNAs arise during the adaptive 'ping-pong' cycle, with their 5' termini being formed by the activity of PIWIs themselves. A number of proteins have been implicated genetically in primary piRNA biogenesis. One of these, Drosophila melanogaster Zucchini, is a member of the phospholipase-D family of phosphodiesterases, which includes both phospholipases and nucleases. Here we produced a dimeric, soluble fragment of the mouse Zucchini homologue (mZuc; also known as PLD6) and show that it possesses single-strand-specific nuclease activity. A crystal structure of mZuc at 1.75 \AA resolution indicates greater architectural similarity to phospholipase-D family nucleases than to phospholipases. Together, our data suggest that the Zucchini proteins act in primary piRNA biogenesis as nucleases, perhaps generating the 5' ends of primary piRNAs.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Alternative splicing is central for cellular processes and substantially increases transcriptome and proteome diversity. Aberrant splicing events often have pathological consequences and are associated with various diseases and cancer types. The emergence of next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides an exciting new technology to analyse alternative splicing on a large scale. However, algorithms that enable the analysis of alternative splicing from short-read sequencing are not fully established yet and there are still no standard solutions available for a variety of data analysis tasks. RESULTS: We present a new method and software to predict genes that are differentially spliced between two different conditions using RNA-seq data. Our method employs geometric angles between the high dimensional vectors of exon read counts. With this, differential splicing can be detected even if the splicing events comprise of higher complexity and involve previously unknown splicing patterns. We applied our approach to two case studies including neuroblastoma tumour data with favourable and unfavourable clinical courses. We show the validity of our predictions as well as the applicability of our method in the context of patient clustering. We verified our predictions by several methods including simulated experiments and complementary in silico analyses of the biological data itself. We found a significant number of exons with specific regulatory splicing factor motifs for predicted genes and a substantial number of publications linking those genes to alternative splicing. Furthermore, we could successfully exploit splicing information to cluster tissues and patients. Finally, we found additional evidence of splicing diversity for many predicted genes in normalised read coverage plots and in reads that span exon-exon junctions.

Despite the wealth of information about gene expression patterns and regulations important for this process, it is not clear how spatio-temporal expression of the key factor Miwi during spermatogenesis is controlled. We have characterized the functional promoter of the mouse Miwi gene. Transgenic mice harboring EGFP under the Miwi core promoter containing just the functional CCAAT box and E2 box were generated and demonstrated that it can direct germ cell–specific expression. We further identified the transcription factors NF-Y and USF1/2 as activators of Miwi gene expression, through their binding to the CCAAT box and E-box/E2 site of the Miwi promoter, respectively. A CpG dinucleotide just located within the USF binding site is responsible for mediating methylation-dependent silencing of the Miwi gene. Our findings provide new insight into an epigenetic regulation mechanism for the spatio-temporal expression of the mouse Miwi during spermatogenesis.},

abstract = {The genomes of higher organisms are packaged in nucleosomes with functional histone modifications. Until now, genome-wide nucleosome and histone modification studies have focused on transcription start sites (TSSs) where nucleosomes in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) occupied genes are well positioned and have histone modifications that are characteristic of expression status. Using public data, we here show that there is a higher nucleosome-positioning signal in internal human exons and that this positioning is independent of expression. We observed a similarly strong nucleosome-positioning signal in internal exons of Caenorhabditis elegans. Among the 38 histone modifications analyzed in man, H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 had evidently higher signals in internal exons than in the following introns and were clearly related to exon expression. These observations are suggestive of roles in splicing. Thus, exons are not only characterized by their coding capacity, but also by their nucleosome organization, which seems evolutionarily conserved since it is present in both primates and nematodes.},

abstract = {Summary
Small RNA-mediated gene regulation during development causes long-lasting changes in cellular phenotypes. To determine whether small RNAs of the adult brain can regulate memory storage, a process that requires stable and long-lasting changes in the functional state of neurons, we generated small RNA libraries from the Aplysia CNS. In these libraries, we discovered an unexpectedly abundant expression of a 28 nucleotide sized class of piRNAs in brain, which had been thought to be germline specific. These piRNAs have unique biogenesis patterns, predominant nuclear localization, and robust sensitivity to serotonin, a modulatory transmitter that is important for memory. We find that the Piwi/piRNA complex facilitates serotonin-dependent methylation of a conserved CpG island in the promoter of CREB2, the major inhibitory constraint of memory in Aplysia, leading to enhanced long-term synaptic facilitation. These findings provide a small RNA-mediated gene regulatory mechanism for establishing stable long-term changes in neurons for the persistence of memory.},

@article{Lenasi2006,
abstract = {The complexity of cotranscriptional splicing is reflected in the coordinated interplay between various cis-elements and transacting factors. In this report, we demonstrated that a cis-element in intron 1 of the equine $\beta$-casein gene (intronic splicing enhancer 1, ISE1) increases the inclusion of all weak exons in its pre-mRNA. The ISE1 also functioned on a hybrid transcript, which was transcribed from the $\alpha$-globin promoter, where it increased the inclusion of the human fibronectin EDA exon and the $\beta$-casein exon 5. The region of ISE1 necessary for its function included the same sequence as is found in some exonic splicing enhancers. Since the ISE1 influenced the splicing of the entire transcript from intron 1, we propose a model for the cotranscriptional splicing of $\beta$-casein mRNA, where the 5′ end of the growing transcript remains associated with the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. Thus, the ISE1 remains in close proximity to the mRNA exit groove throughout transcription and influences all weak exons as soon as they are copied.},

However, when we took into account tRNA redundancies by grouping Pol III occupancy into 46 anticodon isoacceptor families or 21 amino acid-based isotype classes, we discovered strong conservation. Similarly, Pol III occupancy of amino acid isotypes is almost invariant among transcriptionally and evolutionarily diverse tissues in mouse.

We now report that disruption of mouse Spo11 leads to severe gonadal abnormalities from defective meiosis. Spermatocytes suffer apoptotic death during early prophase; oocytes reach the diplotene/dictyate stage in nearly normal numbers, but most die soon after birth. Consistent with a conserved function in initiating meiotic recombination, Dmc1/Rad51 focus formation is abolished. Spo11(-/-) meiocytes also display homologous chromosome synapsis defects, similar to fungi but distinct from flies and nematodes. We propose that recombination initiation precedes and is required for normal synapsis in mammals. Our results also support the view that mammalian checkpoint responses to meiotic recombination and/or synapsis defects are sexually dimorphic.},

abstract = {Organisms employ a fascinating array of strategies to silence invasive nucleic acids such as transposons and viruses. Although evidence exists for several pathways that detect foreign sequences, including pathways that sense copy number, unpaired DNA, or aberrant RNA (e.g., dsRNA), in many cases, the mechanisms used to distinguish "self" from "nonself" nucleic acids remain mysterious. Here, we describe an RNA-induced epigenetic silencing pathway that permanently silences single-copy transgenes. We show that the Piwi Argonaute PRG-1 and its genomically encoded piRNA cofactors initiate permanent silencing, and maintenance depends on chromatin factors and the WAGO Argonaute pathway. Our findings support a model in which PRG-1 scans for foreign sequences and two other Argonaute pathways serve as epigenetic memories of "self" and "nonself" RNAs. These findings suggest how organisms can utilize RNAi-related mechanisms to detect foreign sequences not by any molecular signature, but by comparing the foreign sequence to a memory of previous gene expression.},

abstract = {The myb gene family consists of three members, A-myb, B-myb and c-myb. The proteins encoded by these genes bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and regulate transcription of target genes. In this communication, we report the nucleotide sequence of murine A-myb cDNA. This gene encodes a protein of 751 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 83 kDa. cDNA sequence analysis of multiple independent cDNA clones reveals the presence of alternatively spliced mRNAs that encode smaller proteins. Northern blot analysis of adult mouse tissue RNAs reveals A-myb expression predominantly in the testis, with very low levels of expression in the ovaries, spleen and brain. In situ hybridization analysis of adult mouse testis shows that this gene is expressed at high levels in type A spermatogonia (stem cells), and preleptotene and pachytene spermatocytes, with concomitant down-regulation of expression upon terminal differentiation of these cells into mature spermatozoa. This pattern of expression suggests that A-myb is involved in the control of proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia. This potential function of A-myb in spermatogenesis is reminiscent of the role of c-myb in hematopoiesis.},

In flies, somatic cells produce siRNAs from exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a defense against viral infection. We identified endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs), 21 nucleotides in length, that correspond to transposons and heterochromatic sequences in the somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. We also detected endo-siRNAs complementary to messenger RNAs (mRNAs); these siRNAs disproportionately mapped to the complementary regions of overlapping mRNAs predicted to form double-stranded RNA in vivo. Normal accumulation of somatic endo-siRNAs requires the siRNA-generating ribonuclease Dicer-2 and the RNAi effector protein Argonaute2 (Ago2). We propose that endo-siRNAs generated by the fly RNAi pathway silence selfish genetic elements in the soma, much as Piwi-interacting RNAs do in the germ line.},

abstract = {Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have recently described a bona fide deletion within the coding sequence of the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (R1) mRNA in colon cancer. Consecutive studies have raised questions about the nature of this phenomenon, because the corresponding genomic alteration at the DNA level or an aberrant protein could not be detected. Thus we considered an in vitro artifact during RT-PCR as a possible explanation for this observation. In contrast to reverse transcriptase, Taq DNA polymerase or C. therm DNA polymerase did not generate the aberrant product, suggesting the demand for the template switching activity intrinsic to retroviral reverse transcriptases. In fact, virtually the same deletion was observed in RT-PCR experiments when in vitro transcribed R1 mRNA was used. Considering structural prerequisites for template switching within R1 mRNA, we show that two direct repeats adjacent to a strong stem-loop secondary structure flank the deleted region of 1851 base pairs. Because several mRNAs encoding proteins of clinical and diagnostic importance fulfill these criteria, template switching enhances the potential risk of observing artifacts when interpreting results from RT-PCR studies. As shown in the present example, this may involve the artificial generation and the misinterpretation of PCR fragments amplified from targets relevant to tumor biology or cancer pharmacology. As a possible solution, one-step PCR with C. therm polymerase should be considered. This polymerase eliminates the artificial generation of aberrant mRNA signals observed during cDNA synthesis.},

@article{Li2009a,
abstract = {Sterility is a commonly observed phenotype in interspecific hybrids. Sterility may result from chromosomal or genic incompatibilities, and much progress has been made toward understanding the genetic basis of hybrid sterility in various taxa. The underlying mechanisms causing hybrid sterility, however, are less well known. The pachytene checkpoint is a meiotic surveillance system that many organisms use to detect aberrant meiotic products, in order to prevent the production of defective gametes. We suggest that activation of the pachytene checkpoint may be an important mechanism contributing to two types of hybrid sterility. First, the pachytene checkpoint may form the mechanistic basis of some gene-based hybrid sterility phenotypes. Second, the pachytene checkpoint may be an important mechanism that mediates chromosomal-based hybrid sterility phenotypes involving gametes with non-haploid (either non-reduced or aneuploid) chromosome sets. Studies in several species suggest that the strength of the pachytene checkpoint is sexually dimorphic, observations that warrant future investigation into whether such variation may contribute to differences in patterns of sterility between male and female interspecific hybrids. In addition, plants seem to lack the pachytene checkpoint, which correlates with increased production of unreduced gametes and a higher incidence of polyploid species in plants versus animals. Although the pachytene checkpoint occurs in many animals and in fungi, at least some of the genes that execute the pachytene checkpoint are different among organisms. This finding suggests that the penetrance of the pachytene checkpoint, and even its presence or absence can evolve rapidly. The surprising degree of evolutionary flexibility in this meiotic surveillance system may contribute to the observed variation in patterns of hybrid sterility and in rates of polyploidization.},

Results are consistent with a polymerase immobilized in a 'factory' capturing a promoter and reeling in the template, as the transcript and promoter are extruded. Initially, the extruded promoter is tethered close to the factory and so likely to re-initiate; later, the tether becomes long enough to allow re-initiation in another factory. We suggest close tethering underlies enhancer function and transcriptional 'bursting'.},

Bacteriophage T4 RNA ligase (gp63) is the best-studied member of this class of enzymes, which includes yeast tRNA ligase and trypanosome RNA-editing ligases. Here, we identified another RNA ligase from the bacterial domain—a second RNA ligase (Rnl2) encoded by phage T4. Purified Rnl2 (gp24.1) catalyzes intramolecular and intermolecular RNA strand joining through ligase-adenylate and RNA-adenylate intermediates. Mutational analysis identifies amino acids required for the ligase-adenylation or phosphodiester synthesis steps of the ligation reaction. The catalytic residues of Rnl2 are located within nucleotidyl transferase motifs I, IV, and V that are conserved in DNA ligases and RNA capping enzymes. Rnl2 has scant amino acid similarity to T4 gp63. Rather, Rnl2 exemplifies a distinct ligase family, defined by variant motifs, that includes the trypanosome-editing ligases and a group of putative RNA ligases encoded by eukaryotic viruses (baculoviruses and an entomopoxvirus) and many species of archaea. These findings have implications for the evolution of covalent nucleotidyl transferases and virus-host dynamics based on RNA restriction and repair.},

abstract = {<p>Summary<br/>Signaling pathways are controlled by a vast array of posttranslational mechanisms. By contrast, little is known regarding the mechanisms that regulate the expression of their core components. We conducted an RNAi screen in Drosophila for factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling and identified the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) as a key element of this pathway. The EJC binds the exon-exon junctions of mRNAs and thus far, has been linked exclusively to postsplicing events. Here, we report that the EJC is required for proper splicing of mapk transcripts by a mechanism that apparently controls exon definition. Moreover, whole transcriptome and RT-PCR analyses of EJC-depleted cells revealed that the splicing of long intron-containing genes, which includes mapk, is sensitive to EJC activity. These results identify a role for the EJC in the splicing of a subset of transcripts and suggest that RAS/MAPK signaling depends on the regulation of MAPK levels by the EJC.</p>},

abstract = {Most human genes contain multiple alternative splice sites believed to extend the complexity and diversity of the proteome. However, little is known about how interactions among alternative exons regulate protein function. We used the Caenorhabditis elegans slo-1 large-conductance calcium and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channel gene, which contains three alternative splice sites (A, B, and C) and encodes at least 12 splice variants, to investigate the functional consequences of alternative splicing. These splice sites enable the insertion of exons encoding part of the regulator of K+ conductance (RCK)1 Ca2+ coordination domain (exons A1 and A2) and portions of the RCK1–RCK2 linker (exons B0, B1, B2, C0, and C1). Exons A1 and A2 are used in a mutually exclusive manner and are 67\% identical. The other exons can extend the RCK1–RCK2 linker by up to 41 residues. Electrophysiological recordings of all isoforms show that the A1 and A2 exons regulate activation kinetics and Ca2+ sensitivity, but only if alternate exons are inserted at site B or C. Thus, RCK1 interacts with the RCK1–RCK2 linker, and the effect of exon variation on gating depends on the combination of alternate exons present in each isoform.},

abstract = {Polyadenylylated [poly(A)+] mRNA from HeLa cells that were labeled with [3H-methyl]-methionine and 14C-uridine was isolated by poly(U)-Sepharose chromatography. The presence of approximately two methyl groups per 1000 nucleotides of poly(A)+ RNA was calculated from the 3H/14C ratios and known degrees of methylation of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs. All four 2'-O-methylribonucleosides, but only two base-methylated derivatives, 7-methylguanosine (7MeG) and 6-methyladenosine (6MeA), were identified. 6MeA was the major component accounting for approximately 50\% of the total methyl-labeled ribonucleosides. 7MeG, comprising about 10\% of the total, was present exclusively at the 5' terminus of the poly(A)+ RNA and could be removed by periodate oxidation and beta elimination. Evidence for a 5' to 5' linkage of 7MeG to adjacent 2'-O-methylribonucleosides through at least two and probably three phosphates to give structures of the type 7MeG5'ppp5pNMep- and 7MeG5'ppp5'NMepNmep- was presented. The previous finding of similar sequences of methylated nucleotides in mRNA synthesized in vitro by enzymes associated with virus cores indicates that blocked 5' termini may be a characteristic feature of mRNAs that function in eucaryotic cells.},

First, two mouse strains that differ in hotspot usage are polymorphic for the zinc finger DNA binding array of PRDM9. Second, the human consensus PRDM9 allele is predicted to recognize the 13-mer motif enriched at human hotspots; this DNA binding specificity is verified by in vitro studies. Third, allelic variants of PRDM9 zinc fingers are significantly associated with variability in genome-wide hotspot usage among humans. Our results provide a molecular basis for the distribution of meiotic recombination in mammals, in which the binding of PRDM9 to specific DNA sequences targets the initiation of recombination at specific locations in the genome.},

abstract = {Many therapeutic agents are associated with adverse effects in patients. Anticoagulants can engender acute complications such as significant bleeding that increases patient morbidity and mortality1. Antidote control provides the safest means to regulate drug action. For this reason, despite its known limitations and toxicities, heparin use remains high because it is the only anticoagulant that can be controlled by an antidote, the polypeptide protamine2, 3, 4. To date, no generalizable strategy for developing drug–antidote pairs has been described. We investigated whether drug–antidote pairs could be rationally designed by taking advantage of properties inherent to nucleic acids to make antidote-controlled anticoagulant agents. Here we show that protein-binding oligonucleotides (aptamers) against coagulation factor IXa are potent anticoagulants. We also show that oligonucleotides complementary to these aptamers can act as antidotes capable of efficiently reversing the activity of these new anticoagulants in plasma from healthy volunteers and from patients who cannot tolerate heparin5. This generalizable strategy for rationally designing a drug–antidote pair thus opens up the way for developing safer regulatable therapeutics.},

Applying GRIT to Drosophila melanogaster short-read RNA-seq, cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) and poly(A)-site-seq data collected for the modENCODE project, we recovered the vast majority of previously annotated transcripts and doubled the total number of transcripts cataloged. We found that 20\% of protein coding genes encode multiple protein-localization signals and that, in 20-d-old adult fly heads, genes with multiple polyadenylation sites are more common than genes with alternative splicing or alternative promoters. GRIT demonstrates 30\% higher precision and recall than the most widely used transcript assembly tools. GRIT will facilitate the automated generation of high-quality genome annotations without the need for extensive manual annotation.},

Here we report the identification of Drosophila zucchini (zuc) and squash (squ), which function in germline RNAi processes. Zuc and Squ contain domains with homologies to nucleases. Mutant females are sterile and show dorsoventral patterning defects during oogenesis. In addition, Oskar protein is ectopically expressed in early oocytes, where it is normally silenced by RNAi mechanisms. Zuc and Squ localize to the perinuclear nuage and interact with Aubergine, a PIWI class protein. Mutations in zuc and squ induce the upregulation of Het-A and Tart, two telomere-specific transposable elements, and the expression of Stellate protein in the Drosophila germline. We show that these defects are due to the inability of zuc and squ mutants to produce repeat-associated small interfering RNAs.},

abstract = {Alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing is an important mechanism for generating protein diversity and may explain in part how mammalian complexity arises from a surprisingly small complement of genes. Here, we describe "digital polony exon profiling,"a single molecule-based technology for studying complex alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing. This technology allows researchers to monitor the combinatorial diversity of exon inclusion in individual transcripts. A minisequencing strategy provides single nucleotide resolution, and the digital nature of the technology allows quantitation of individual splicing variants. Digital polony exon profiling can be used to investigate the physiological and pathological roles of alternately spliced messenger RNAs, as well as the mechanisms by which these messenger RNAs are produced.},

abstract = {Myogenic cell lines have proven extremely valuable for studying myogenesis in vitro. Although a number of mammalian muscle cell lines have been isolated, attempts to produce cell lines from other classes of animals have met with only limited success. We report here the isolation and characterization of seven avian myogenic cell lines (QM1–4 and QM61–8), derived from the quail fibrosarcoma cell line QT6. A differentiation incompetent QM cell derivative was also isolated (QM5DI). The major features of QM cell differentiation in vitro closely resemble those of their mammalian counterparts. Mononucleated QM cells replicate in medium containing high concentrations of serum components. Upon switching to medium containing low serum components, cells withdraw from the cell cycle and fuse to form elongated multinucleated myotubes. Cultures typically obtain fusion indices of 43–49\%. Northern blot and immunoblot analyses demonstrate that each differentiated QM cell line expresses a wide variety of genes encoding muscle specific proteins: desmin, cardiac troponin T, skeletal troponin T, cardiac troponin C, skeletal troponin I, $\alpha$-tropomyosin, muscle creatine kinase, myosin light chain 2, and a ventricular isoform of myosin heavy chain. While all QM lines analyzed to date express at least some myosin light chain 2, only one line, QM7, expresses this gene at high levels. Surprisingly, none of the QM lines reported here express any known form of $\alpha$-actin. The absence of sarcomeric actin expression may explain the absence of myofibrils in QM myotubes. These novel features of muscle gene expression in QM cells may prove useful for studying the role of specific muscle proteins during myogenesis. More importantly, however, the isolation of QM cell lines indicates that it may be feasible to isolate other avian myogenic cells lines with general utility for the study of muscle development.},

abstract = {Pre-mRNA structure impacts many cellular processes, including splicing in genes associated with disease. The contemporary paradigm of RNA structure prediction is biased toward secondary structures that occur within short ranges of pre-mRNA, although long-range base-pairings are known to be at least as important. Recently, we developed an efficient method for detecting conserved RNA structures on the genome-wide scale, one that does not require multiple sequence alignments and works equally well for the detection of local and long-range base-pairings. Using an enhanced method that detects base-pairings at all possible combinations of splice sites within each gene, we now report RNA structures that could be involved in the regulation of splicing in mammals. Statistically, we demonstrate strong association between the occurrence of conserved RNA structures and alternative splicing, where local RNA structures are generally more frequent at alternative donor splice sites, while long-range structures are more associated with weak alternative acceptor splice sites. As an example, we validated the RNA structure in the human SF1 gene using minigenes in the HEK293 cell line. Point mutations that disrupted the base-pairing of two complementary boxes between exons 9 and 10 of this gene altered the splicing pattern, while the compensatory mutations that reestablished the base-pairing reverted splicing to that of the wild-type. There is statistical evidence for a Dscam-like class of mammalian genes, in which mutually exclusive RNA structures control mutually exclusive alternative splicing. In sum, we propose that long-range base-pairings carry an important, yet unconsidered part of the splicing code, and that, even by modest estimates, there must be thousands of such potentially regulatory structures conserved throughout the evolutionary history of mammals.},

abstract = {Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein levels and phenotypic output, with important functional consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs or proteins simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits.},

To determine if the sequences bound by the particles play a role in RNA processing, we have correlated the nascent transcript morphology of Drosophila chorion s36-1 and s38-1 genes with their nucleotide sequences. We find that RNP particles about 25 nm in diameter are at the splice junctions of the introns in these two transcripts. On the more mature chorion transcripts, a single larger (40 nm) particle is occasionally seen in the same vicinity, which probably results from the coalescence of the two smaller particles.

The genomes of two phycodnaviruses have been sequenced: the 331 kb genome of Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus (PBCV-1) and more recently, the 336 kb genome of the Ectocarpus siliculosus virus (EsV-1). EsV-1 has approximately 231 protein-encoding genes whereas, the slightly smaller PBCV-1 genome has 11 tRNA genes and approximately 375 protein-encoding genes. Surprisingly, the two viruses only have 33 genes in common, of which 17 have no counterparts in the databases. The low number of homologous genes between the two viruses can probably be attributed to their different life styles. PBCV-1 is a lytic virus that infects a unicellular, endosymbiotic freshwater green alga whereas, EsV-1 is a lysogenic virus that infects a free-living filamentous marine brown alga. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that the phycodnaviruses and their genes are ancient, thus allowing significant differences to have evolved. This review briefly describes some of the biological properties of the phycodnaviruses, focusing on PBCV-1 and EsV-1, and then compares their genomes.},

abstract = {Host-defense mechanisms against transposable elements are critical to protect the genome information. Here we show that tudor-domain containing 9 (Tdrd9) is essential for silencing Line-1 retrotransposon in the mouse male germline. Tdrd9 encodes an ATPase/DExH-type helicase, and its mutation causes male sterility showing meiotic failure. In Tdrd9 mutants, Line-1 was highly activated and piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) corresponding to Line-1 were increased, suggesting that feedforward amplification operates in the mutant. In fetal testes, Tdrd9 mutation causes Line-1 desilencing and an aberrant piRNA profile in prospermatogonia, followed by cognate DNA demethylation. TDRD9 complexes with MIWI2 with distinct compartmentalization in processing bodies, and this TDRD9-MIWI2 localization is regulated by MILI and TDRD1 residing at intermitochondrial cement. Our results identify TDRD9 as a functional partner of MIWI2 and indicate that the tudor-piwi association is a conserved feature, while two separate axes, TDRD9-MIWI2 and TDRD1-MILI, cooperate nonredundantly in the piwi-small RNA pathway in the mouse male germline.},

abstract = {CD44 designates a large family of proteins with a considerable structural and functional diversity, which are generated from one gene by alternative splicing. As such, the overexpression of CD44 variant isoform (CD44v) has been causally related to the metastatic spread of cancer cells. To study the underlying mechanism, stable knockdown clones with deletion of exon v7 containing CD44 isoforms (CD44v(kd)) of the highly metastatic rat adenocarcinoma line BSp73ASML (ASML(wt)) were established. ASML-CD44v(kd) clones hardly form lung metastases after intrafootpad application and the metastatic load in lymph nodes is significantly reduced. Rescuing, albeit at a reduced level, CD44v expression in ASML-CD44v(kd) cells (ASML-CD44v(rsc)) restores the metastatic potential. The following major differences in ASML(wt), ASML-CD44v(kd), and ASML-CD44v(rsc) clones were observed: (a) ASML(wt) cells produce and assemble a matrix in a CD44v-dependent manner, which supports integrin-mediated adhesion and favors survival. This feature is lost in the ASML-CD44v(kd) cells. (b) CD44v cross-linking initiates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activation in ASML(wt) cells. Accordingly, apoptosis resistance is strikingly reduced in ASML-CD44v(kd) cells. The capacity to generate an adhesive matrix but not apoptosis resistance is restored in ASML-CD44v(rsc) cells. These data argue for a 2-fold effect of CD44v on metastasis formation: CD44v-mediated matrix formation is crucial for the settlement and growth at a secondary site, whereas apoptosis resistance supports the efficacy of metastasis formation.

abstract = {Epigenetic control of gene expression is a critical component of transcriptional regulation. Remarkably, the deposition of epigenetic modifications is often guided by noncoding RNAs. Although noncoding RNAs have been most often implicated in posttranscriptional gene silencing, these molecules are now emerging as crit- ical regulators of gene expression and genomic stability at the transcriptional level. Here, we review recent efforts to understand the mechanisms by which RNA controls the expression or content of DNA. We discuss the role of both small RNAs and long noncoding RNAs in directing chromatin changes through histone modi- fications and DNA methylation. Furthermore, we highlight the function of RNA in mediating DNA cleavage during genome rearrangements and pathogen defense. In understanding the mechanisms of RNA control over DNA, the power of RNA may one day be harnessed to impact gene expression in a therapeutic setting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Alternative splicing of messenger RNA permits the formation of a wide range of mature RNA transcripts and has the potential to generate a diverse spectrum of functional proteins. Although there is extensive evidence for large scale alternative splicing at the transcript level there have been no comparable studies demonstrating the existence of alternatively spliced protein isoforms.RESULTS:Recent advances in proteomics technology have allowed us to carry out a comprehensive identification of protein isoforms in Drosophila. The analysis of this proteomic data confirmed the presence of multiple alternative gene products for over a hundred Drosophila genes. CONCLUSIONS:We demonstrate that proteomics techniques can detect the expression of stable alternative splice isoforms on a genome-wide scale. Many of these alternative isoforms are likely to have regions that are disordered in solution, and specific proteomics methodologies may be required to identify these peptides.},

abstract = {Author Summary        Retroviruses are intracellular parasites that utilize the host translation machinery to catalyze viral protein synthesis. The activity of the translation machinery fluctuates during cell cycle progression and is reduced in the G2/M phase. HIV-1 infection causes the cells to arrest in the G2/M phase, which has the potential to alter the activity of the translation machinery. Herein several lines of evidence demonstrated that lymphocyte mRNA translation is suppressed by the action of HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr. The molecular basis of translation suppression is reduced activity of the rate-limiting translation intitation factor, eIF4E. However, synthesis of the viral structural proteins is sustained and is due to the difference in composition of the viral and cellular mRNA-ribonucleoprotein complexes. Both cellular and completely spliced viral mRNAs are predominantly associated with the cytoplasmic cap binding protein, eIF4E. In contrast, unspliced HIV-1 mRNAs are predominantly associated with the components of the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC). The retention of CBC on the viral mRNAs provides a mechanism to sustain viral protein synthesis. This newly characterized interface of the virus-host-protein synthesis machinery is likely a cellular adaptation used to enable synthesis of proteins that reengage the cell cycle and facilitate recovery from stress.},

abstract = {The translation machinery recognizes codons that enter the ribosomal A site with remarkable accuracy to ensure that polypeptide synthesis proceeds with a minimum of errors. When a termination codon enters the A site of a eukaryotic ribosome, it is recognized by the release factor eRF1. It has been suggested that the recognition of translation termination signals in these organisms is not limited to a simple trinucleotide codon, but is instead recognized by an extended tetranucleotide termination signal comprised of the stop codon and the first nucleotide that follows. Interestingly, pharmacological agents such as aminoglycoside antibiotics can reduce the efficiency of translation termination by a mechanism that alters this ribosomal proofreading process. This leads to the misincorporation of an amino acid through the pairing of a near-cognate aminoacyl tRNA with the stop codon. To determine whether the sequence context surrounding a stop codon can influence aminoglycoside-mediated suppression of translation termination signals, we developed a series of readthrough constructs that contained different tetranucleotide termination signals, as well as differences in the three bases upstream and downstream of the stop codon. Our results demonstrate that the sequences surrounding a stop codon can play an important role in determining its susceptibility to suppression by aminoglycosides. Furthermore, these distal sequences were found to influence the level of suppression in remarkably distinct ways. These results suggest that the mRNA context influences the suppression of stop codons in response to subtle differences in the conformation of the ribosomal decoding site that result from aminoglycoside binding.},

abstract = {Most mammalian genes produce multiple distinct messenger RNAs through alternative splicing, but the extent of splicing conservation is not clear. To assess tissue-specific transcriptome variation across mammals, we sequenced complementary DNA from nine tissues from four mammals and one bird in biological triplicate, at unprecedented depth. We find that while tissue-specific gene expression programs are largely conserved, alternative splicing is well conserved in only a subset of tissues and is frequently lineage-specific. Thousands of previously unknown, lineage-specific, and conserved alternative exons were identified; widely conserved alternative exons had signatures of binding by MBNL, PTB, RBFOX, STAR, and TIA family splicing factors, implicating them as ancestral mammalian splicing regulators. Our data also indicate that alternative splicing often alters protein phosphorylatability, delimiting the scope of kinase signaling.},
annote = {From 2014 Spiceosomal pre-mRNA splicing book:
>Two recent studies investigating the evolution of alternative splicing in vertebrates found most alternative splicing to be more related to the species than to the organ type [ 22 , 23 ]. This result argues that many alternative events have recently evolved and that conservation may not be the most informative parameter used to determine if an alternative splicing event is important. Additionally, the authors observed that differences in alternative splicing con- tribute more signifi cantly to phenotypic variation than gene expres- sion levels [ 22 , 23 ].

abstract = {Template switching (TS) has been an inherent mechanism of reverse transcriptase, which has been exploited in several transcriptome analysis methods, such as CAGE, RNA-Seq and short RNA sequencing. TS is an attractive option, given the simplicity of the protocol, which does not require an adaptor mediated step and thus minimizes sample loss. As such, it has been used in several studies that deal with limited amounts of RNA, such as in single cell studies. Additionally, TS has also been used to introduce DNA barcodes or indexes into different samples, cells or molecules. This labeling allows one to pool several samples into one sequencing flow cell, increasing the data throughput of sequencing and takes advantage of the increasing throughput of current sequences. Here, we report TS artifacts that form owing to a process called strand invasion. Due to the way in which barcodes/indexes are introduced by TS, strand invasion becomes more problematic by introducing unsystematic biases. We describe a strategy that eliminates these artifacts in silico and propose an experimental solution that suppresses biases from TS.},

To reveal the function of the mammalian homolog of piwi, we produced and analyzed mice with targeted mutations in the Mili gene, which is one of three mouse homologs of piwi. Spermatogenesis in the MILI-null mice was blocked completely at the early prophase of the first meiosis, from the zygotene to early pachytene, and the mice were sterile. However, primordial germ cell development and female germ cell production were not disturbed. Furthermore, MILI bound to MVH, which is an essential factor during the early spermatocyte stage. The similarities in the phenotypes of the MILI- and MVH-deficient mice and in the physical binding properties of MILI and MVH indicate a functional association of these proteins in post-transcriptional regulation. These data indicate that MILI is essential for the differentiation of spermatocytes.},

@article{Yatsenko2010,
abstract = {Approximately 80 million people worldwide are infertile, and nearly half of all infertility cases are attributed to a male factor. Therefore, progress in reproductive genetics becomes crucial for future diagnosis and treatment of infertility. In recent years, enormous progress has been made in this field.  More than 400 mutant mouse models with specific reproductive abnormalities have been produced, and numerous human association studies have been discovered. However, the translation of basic science findings to clinical practice remains protracted, with only modest progress in the application of novel findings to clinical genetic testing and cures. To date, the most significant findings in male infertility remain numeric and structural chromosomal abnormalities and Y-chromosome microdeletions in infertile men.  Thus, we anticipate that future genetic investigations will focus on infertile men with a normal somatic karyotype but with various spermatozoal defects, like insufficient production of spermatozoa (oligozoospermia), inadequate motility (asthenozoospermia), abnormal morphology (teratozoospermia), or combinations of these defects. Ultimately, basic advances in mammalian nonhuman reproduction will translate to clinical advances in human reproduction and testing for infertile humans, thereby helping to improve  diagnostics and health care for infertile patients.},

abstract = {The chromatoid body (CB) is a germ granule in the cytoplasm of postmeiotic haploid round spermatids that is loaded with RNA and RNA-binding proteins. Following the discovery of small non-coding RNA-mediated gene regulation and the identification of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that have crucial roles in germ line development, the function of the CB has slowly begun to be revealed. Male germ cells utilise small RNAs to control the complex and specialised process of sperm production. Several microRNAs have been identified during spermatogenesis. In addition, a high number of piRNAs are present both in embryonic and postnatal male germ cells, with their expression being impressively induced in late meiotic cells and haploid round spermatids. At postmeiotic stage of germ cell differentiation, the CB accumulates piRNAs and proteins of piRNA machinery, as well as several other proteins involved in distinct RNA regulation pathways. All existing evidence suggests a role for the CB in mRNA regulation and small RNA-mediated gene control, but the mechanisms remain uncharacterised. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge of the CB and its association with small RNA pathways.},

abstract = {Dicer is a multidomain enzyme that generates small RNAs for gene silencing in eukaryotes. Current understanding of Dicer structure is restricted to simple forms of the enzyme, whereas that of the large and complex Dicer in metazoans is unknown. Here we describe a new domain localization strategy developed to determine the structure of human Dicer by EM. A rearrangement of the nuclease core, compared to the archetypal Giardia lamblia Dicer, explains how metazoan Dicers generate products that are 21–23 nucleotides in length. The helicase domains form a clamp-like structure adjacent to the RNase III active site, facilitating recognition of pre-miRNA loops or translocation on long dsRNAs. Drosophila melanogaster Dicer-2 shows similar features, revealing that the three-dimensional architecture is conserved. These results illuminate the structural basis for small RNA production in eukaryotes and provide a versatile new tool for determining structures of large molecular machines.

From a comparison with quantitative alternative splicing microarray profiling data, we also show that mRNA-Seq data provide reliable measurements for exon inclusion levels.},

@article{Wilson1992,
abstract = {During blood clot formation in vivo, plasma fibronectin (pFN) is cross-linked to fibrin by coagulation factor XIIIa. Cellular FN (cFN), which localizes to connective tissue, is distinguished from pFN by the inclusion of alternatively spliced segments. To determine if these two FNs are functionally equivalent in blood clotting, the cross-linking of rat pFN and cFN to fibrin was compared in an in vitro clotting assay. Fibrinogen and FN were incubated at physiological ratios in the presence of thrombin and factor XIIIa. Cross-linking of FN to fibrin was monitored by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Over 24 h, cFN was incorporated at a significantly slower rate than pFN and was not completely cross-linked to fibrin at a temperature that favors this interaction (0 degrees C). This difference was observed with purified fibrinogens from human, rat, and bovine and with rat plasma and was maintained even after incubation of pFN with rat fibroblasts for several days. Using the same assay, purified recombinant V(+)-V0 and V(+)-V+ FN dimers resembling pFN and cFN, respectively, showed a similar difference in cross-linking kinetics. These results suggest that the asymmetric distribution of the V region among pFN dimers plays a role in regulating its incorporation into blood clots. In fibrin clots, cFN was converted into a set of cross-linked intermediates distinct from those of pFN. For example, while pFN was initially cross-linked into a pFN-fibrin alpha heterodimer, this product was not a major intermediate in clots formed with cFN. This finding, in conjunction with evidence for the formation of factor XIIIa-catalyzed cFN-cFN cross-links, indicated that cFN molecules interact with each other, and with fibrin, differently from pFN. Together, these results show an important functional distinction between pFN and cFN.},

abstract = {Dead and dying cells release nucleic acids. These extracellular RNAs and DNAs can be taken up by inflammatory cells and activate multiple nucleic acid-sensing toll-like receptors (TLR3, 7, 8, and 9). The inappropriate activation of these TLRs can engender a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The redundancy of the TLR family encouraged us to seek materials that can neutralize the proinflammatory effects of any nucleic acid regardless of its sequence, structure or chemistry. Herein we demonstrate that certain nucleic acid-binding polymers can inhibit activation of all nucleic acid-sensing TLRs irrespective of whether they recognize ssRNA, dsRNA or hypomethylated DNA. Furthermore, systemic administration of such polymers can prevent fatal liver injury engendered by proinflammatory nucleic acids in an acute toxic shock model in mice. Therefore these polymers represent a novel class of anti-inflammatory agent that can act as molecular scavengers to neutralize the proinflammatory effects of various nucleic acids.},

First, transposon detection prompts the production of small RNAs, which are Piwi-interacting RNAs in some organisms and small interfering RNAs in others. Second, the population of small RNAs targeting active transposons is amplified through an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-based or Slicer-based mechanism. Third, small RNAs are incorporated into Argonaute- or Piwi-containing effector complexes, which target transposon transcripts for post-transcriptional silencing and/or target transposon DNA for repressive chromatin modification and DNA methylation. These properties produce robust systems that limit the catastrophic consequences of transposon mobilization, which can result in the accumulation of deleterious mutations, changes in gene expression patterns, and conditions such as gonadal hypotrophy and sterility.},

abstract = {Small noncoding RNAs, including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and micro RNAs (miRNAs) of approximately 21 nucleotides (nt) in length, have emerged as potent regulators of gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in diverse organisms. Here we report the identification of a novel class of small RNAs in the mouse male germline termed piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). piRNAs are approximately 30 nt in length. They are expressed during spermatogenesis, mostly in spermatids. piRNAs are associated with MIWI, a spermatogenesis-specific PIWI subfamily member of the Argonaute protein family, and depend on MIWI for their biogenesis and/or stability. Furthermore, a subpopulation of piRNAs are associated with polysomes, suggesting their potential role in translational regulation.},

abstract = {Insufficient sleep and circadian rhythm disruption are associated with negative health outcomes, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive impairment, but the mechanisms involved remain largely unexplored. Twenty-six participants were exposed to 1 wk of insufficient sleep (sleep-restriction condition 5.70 h, SEM = 0.03 sleep per 24 h) and 1 wk of sufficient sleep (control condition 8.50 h sleep, SEM = 0.11). Immediately following each condition, 10 whole-blood RNA samples were collected from each participant, while controlling for the effects of light, activity, and food, during a period of total sleep deprivation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 711 genes were up- or down-regulated by insufficient sleep. Insufficient sleep also reduced the number of genes with a circadian expression profile from 1,855 to 1,481, reduced the circadian amplitude of these genes, and led to an increase in the number of genes that responded to subsequent total sleep deprivation from 122 to 856. Genes affected by insufficient sleep were associated with circadian rhythms (PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY2, CLOCK, NR1D1, NR1D2, RORA, DEC1, CSNK1E), sleep homeostasis (IL6, STAT3, KCNV2, CAMK2D), oxidative stress (PRDX2, PRDX5), and metabolism (SLC2A3, SLC2A5, GHRL, ABCA1). Biological processes affected included chromatin modification, gene-expression regulation, macromolecular metabolism, and inflammatory, immune and stress responses. Thus, insufficient sleep affects the human blood transcriptome, disrupts its circadian regulation, and intensifies the effects of acute total sleep deprivation. The identified biological processes may be involved with the negative effects of sleep loss on health, and highlight the interrelatedness of sleep homeostasis, circadian rhythmicity, and metabolism.},

Male germ cell differentiation is governed by orchestrated, phase-specific gene expression patterns that are tightly controlled at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Post-transcriptional regulation of protein-coding mRNAs becomes prominent during the late steps of spermatogenesis when the compacting sperm nucleus becomes transcriptionally inhibited. Small non-coding RNAs are important regulators of gene expression that mainly function post-transcriptionally to control the properties of their target mRNAs. Male germ cells express several classes of small RNAs, including Dicer-dependent microRNAs (miRNAs) and endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs), as well as Dicer-independent piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Increasing evidence supports the essential role of small RNA-mediated RNA regulation in normal spermatogenesis and male fertility.},

Our results suggest that most PTC-introducing AS events are not under positive selection pressure and therefore may not contribute important functional roles.},

@article{Li2009,
abstract = {Summary
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence transposons in animal germ cells. piRNAs are thought to derive from long transcripts spanning transposon-rich genomic loci and to direct an autoamplification loop in which an antisense piRNA, bound to Aubergine or Piwi protein, triggers production of a sense piRNA bound to the PIWI protein Argonaute3 (Ago3). In turn, the new piRNA is envisioned to produce a second antisense piRNA. Here, we describe strong loss-of-function mutations in ago3, allowing a direct genetic test of this model. We find that Ago3 acts to amplify piRNA pools and to enforce on them an antisense bias, increasing the number of piRNAs that can act to silence transposons. We also detect a second, Ago3-independent piRNA pathway centered on Piwi. Transposons targeted by this second pathway often reside in the flamenco locus, which is expressed in somatic ovarian follicle cells, suggesting a role for piRNAs beyond the germline.},

abstract = {Background: T4 RNA ligases 1 and 2 are useful tools for RNA analysis. Their use upstream of RNA analyses such as high-throughput RNA sequencing and microarrays has recently increased their importance. The truncated form of T4 RNA ligase 2, comprising amino acids 1-249 (T4 Rnl2tr), is an attractive tool for attachment of adapters or labels to RNA 3'-ends. Compared to T4 RNA ligase 1, T4 Rnl2tr has a decreased ability to ligate 5'-PO4 ends in single-stranded RNA ligations, and compared to the full-length T4 Rnl2, the T4 Rnl2tr has an increased activity for joining 5'-adenylated adapters to RNA 3'-ends. The combination of these properties allows adapter attachment to RNA 3'-ends with reduced circularization and concatemerization of substrate RNA. Results: With the aim of further reducing unwanted side ligation products, we substituted active site residues, known to be important for adenylyltransferase steps of the ligation reaction, in the context of T4 Rnl2tr. We characterized the variant ligases for the formation of unwanted ligation side products and for activity in the strand-joining reaction. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that lysine 227 is a key residue facilitating adenylyl transfer from adenylated ligation donor substrates to the ligase. This reversal of the second step of the ligation reaction correlates with the formation of unwanted ligation products. Thus, T4 Rn2tr mutants containing the K227Q mutation are useful for reducing undesired ligation products. We furthermore report optimal conditions for the use of these improved T4 Rnl2tr variants.},

We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although >90\% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads.

abstract = {Engineered systems are often built of recurring circuit modules that carry out key functions. Transcription networks that regulate the responses of living cells were recently found to obey similar principles: they contain several biochemical wiring patterns, termed network motifs, which recur throughout the network. One of these motifs is the feed-forward loop (FFL). The FFL, a three-gene pattern, is composed of two input transcription factors, one of which regulates the other, both jointly regulating a target gene. The FFL has eight possible structural types, because each of the three interactions in the FFL can be activating or repressing. Here, we theoretically analyze the functions of these eight structural types. We find that four of the FFL types, termed incoherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive accelerators: they speed up the response time of the target gene expression following stimulus steps in one direction (e.g., off to on) but not in the other direction (on to off). The other four types, coherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive delays. We find that some FFL types appear in transcription network databases much more frequently than others. In some cases, the rare FFL types have reduced functionality (responding to only one of their two input stimuli), which may partially explain why they are selected against. Additional features, such as pulse generation and cooperativity, are discussed. This study defines the function of one of the most significant recurring circuit elements in transcription networks.},

abstract = {Down syndrome (DS), a major cause of mental retardation, is characterized by subtle abnormalities of cortical neuroanatomy, neurochemistry and function. Recent work has shown that chromosome band 21q22 is critical for many of the neurological phenotypes of DS. A gene, DSCAM (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule), has now been isolated from chromosome band 21q22.2-22.3. Homology searches indicate that the putative DSCAM protein is a novel member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that represents a new class of neural cell adhesion molecules. The sequence of cDNAs indicates alternative splicing and predicts two protein isoforms, both containing 10 Ig-C2 domains, with nine at the N-terminus and the tenth located between domains 4 and 5 of the following array of six fibronectin III domains, with or without the following transmembrane and intracellular domains. Northern analyses reveals the transcripts of 9.7, 8.5 and 7.6 kb primarily in brain. These transcripts are differentially expressed in substructures of the adult brain. Tissue in situ hybridization analyses of a mouse homolog of the DSCAM gene revealed broad expression within the nervous system at the time of neuronal differentiation in the neural tube, cortex, hippocampus, medulla, spinal cord and most neural crest-derived tissues. Given its location on chromosome 21, its specific expression in the central nervous system and neural crest, and the homologies to molecules involved in neural migration, differentiation, and synaptic function, we propose that DSCAM is involved in neural differentiation and contributes to the central and peripheral nervous system defects in DS.},

@article{Schor2009,
abstract = {In search for physiological pathways affecting alternative splicing through its kinetic coupling with transcription, we found that membrane depolarization of neuronal cells triggers the skipping of exon 18 from the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) mRNA, independently of the calcium/calmodulin protein kinase IV pathway. We show that this exon responds to RNA polymerase II elongation, because its inclusion is increased by a slow polymerase II mutant. Depolarization affects the chromatin template in a specific way, by causing H3K9 hyper-acetylation restricted to an internal region of the NCAM gene surrounding the alternative exon. This intragenic histone hyper-acetylation is not paralleled by acetylation at the promoter, is associated with chromatin relaxation, and is linked to H3K36 tri-methylation. The effects on acetylation and splicing fully revert when the depolarizing conditions are withdrawn and can be both duplicated and potentiated by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Our results are consistent with a mechanism involving the kinetic coupling of splicing and transcription in response to depolarization through intragenic epigenetic changes on a gene that is relevant for the differentiation and function of neuronal cells.},

The central players are the RNA-binding proteins, and experimental technologies (such as CLIP- and RIP-seq) for probing their activities have advanced rapidly over the course of the past decade. Statistically robust, flexible computational methods for binding site identification from high-throughput immunoprecipitation assays are largely lacking however. RESULTS: We introduce a method for site identification which provides four key advantages over previous methods: (1) it can be applied on all variations of CLIP and RIP-seq technologies, (2) it accurately models the underlying read-count distributions, (3) it allows external covariates, such as transcript abundance (which we demonstrate is highly correlated with read count) to inform the site identification process, and (4) it allows for direct comparison of site usage across cell-types or conditions.

abstract = {Neurexins are evolutionarily conserved presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that are essential for normal synapse formation and synaptic transmission. Indirect evidence has indicated that extensive alternative splicing of neurexin mRNAs may produce hundreds if not thousands of neurexin isoforms, but no direct evidence for such diversity has been available. Here we use unbiased long-read sequencing of full-length neurexin (Nrxn)1$\alpha$, Nrxn1$\beta$, Nrxn2$\beta$, Nrxn3$\alpha$, and Nrxn3$\beta$ mRNAs to systematically assess how many sites of alternative splicing are used in neurexins with a significant frequency, and whether alternative splicing events at these sites are independent of each other. In sequencing more than 25,000 full-length mRNAs, we identified a novel, abundantly used alternatively spliced exon of Nrxn1$\alpha$ and Nrxn3$\alpha$ (referred to as alternatively spliced sequence 6) that encodes a 9-residue insertion in the flexible hinge region between the fifth LNS (laminin-$\alpha$, neurexin, sex hormone-binding globulin) domain and the third EGF-like sequence. In addition, we observed several larger-scale events of alternative splicing that deleted multiple domains and were much less frequent than the canonical six sites of alternative splicing in neurexins. All of the six canonical events of alternative splicing appear to be independent of each other, suggesting that neurexins may exhibit an even larger isoform diversity than previously envisioned and comprise thousands of variants. Our data are consistent with the notion that $\alpha$-neurexins represent extracellular protein-interaction scaffolds in which different LNS and EGF domains mediate distinct interactions that affect diverse functions and are independently regulated by independent events of alternative splicing.},

Extensive northern analyses validated the accumulation of full-length neural extended transcripts, and in situ hybridization indicated their spatial restriction to the CNS. Genes encoding RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and transcription factors were preferentially subject to 3' UTR extensions. Motif analysis indicated enrichment of miRNA and RBP sites in the neural extensions, and their termini were enriched in canonical cis elements that promote cleavage and polyadenylation. Altogether, we reveal broad tissue-specific patterns of APA in Drosophila and transcripts with unprecedented 3' UTR length in the nervous system.},

Several examples of alternative UTRs have been characterized, including those found in AXIN2, FGF1 and BRCA1. Results from bioinformatics studies indicate that this mechanism is more common than previously appreciated.},

abstract = {aDepartment of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, College of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-4025, USA bDepartment of Genetics and Developmental Biology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT 06030-3301, USA SR proteins are essential metazoan splicing factors that contain an RNA-binding domain and an arginine/serine-rich domain that functions to promote assembly of the spliceosome. The prevailing model over the past several years suggests that the RS domains function as protein-interaction domains. However, two new papers from Green et al. demonstrate that these RS domains directly contact the pre-mRNA within the functional spliceosome. The sequential character of these contacts suggests that RS domain interactions with RNA promote spliceosome assembly. Most eukaryotic genes contain introns that are removed from pre-mRNAs by the spliceosome, which is a large complex of proteins and five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) [1]. The spliceosome assembles onto the pre-mRNA in a coordinated series of intricate movements by binding to sequences located at the 5′ and 3′ ends of introns. Given the degenerate nature of these splicing signals in higher eukaryotes, the fidelity of intron removal is truly remarkable. Spliceosome assembly is initiated by the stable associations of (i) U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) with the 5′ splice site, (ii) branchpoint-binding protein SF1 with the branchpoint, and (iii) U2 snRNP auxiliary factor (U2AF) with the pyrimidine tract (E complex) (Figure 1). ATP hydrolysis then leads to the formation of the A complex, which is characterized by the stable association of U2 snRNP at the branchpoint. After the incorporation of the U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP (B complex), the catalytic spliceosome is formed by massive structural rearrangements. A common feature of all these rearrangements is the repeated breaking and formation of base-pair interactions either between snRNAs or between the pre-mRNA and snRNAs. Serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins are essential splicing factors present in all metazoans but, curiously, are not in lower eukaryotes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae [2]. SR proteins have a variety of functions, but are perhaps best known for their ability to modulate alternative splicing. They do so by binding to exonic sequences called splicing enhancers to activate the splicing of adjacent introns. SR proteins contain an RNA-binding domain and an arginine/serine (RS)-rich domain. The RS domain functions as a modular splicing-activation domain – it can enhance splicing when artificially tethered to a pre-mRNA via a heterologous RNA-binding protein [3]. Although RS domains clearly function as activation domains, the mechanism by which they do so has remained controversial. The most accepted model for the mechanism of SR protein action is the protein–protein interaction model, wherein the RS domain of an enhancer-bound SR protein is proposed to interact directly with other splicing factors that contain an RS domain and, thus, facilitate recruitment of the spliceosome [2]. The two main potential targets are the 70-kDa subunit of U1 snRNP and the 35-kDa subunit of the heterodimeric splicing factor U2AF (U2AF35) 4 and 5. In the case of U2AF35, which has been most extensively studied, RS-domain-mediated interactions between the enhancer-bound SR protein and U2AF35 serve to recruit the large U2AF subunit (U2AF65) and, thus, the spliceosome. There is much experimental evidence supporting this protein–protein interaction model. First, the SR proteins SF2/ASF (splicing factor 2/alternative splicing factor) and SC35 (spliceosomal component 35) have been shown to interact with the U2AF35 subunit in a RS-domain-dependent manner [5]. Interestingly, although not all SR proteins have been tested for this interaction, at least one – SRp54 – does not interact with U2AF35, but rather U2AF65 [6]. Second, several UV-crosslinking experiments using either nuclear extracts or purified recombinant proteins have shown that SR proteins bound to a splicing enhancer promote the binding of U2AF to the 3′ splice site of a regulated intron 7, 8 and 9 and that this activity requires the RS domain of U2AF35 [8]. However, there are several results that are inconsistent with the protein–protein interaction model. Just as some biochemical experiments observed SR protein-dependent U2AF recruitment 7, 8 and 9, other similar experiments failed to observe changes in U2AF binding in the presence or absence of an enhancer 10 and 11. Perhaps more convincing are genetic experiments in Drosophila: flies expressing a version of dU2AF28 (the homolog of U2AF35) that lacks its RS domain – which, therefore, should not interact with SR proteins – are not only viable, but also do not display any defects in the splicing of the doublesex pre-mRNA [12] – one of the model genes for which U2AF recruitment was shown in vitro 8 and 9. Of course, this could be explained by invoking a protein with a redundant function, but such a protein has not been described. Most importantly is that, as yet, none of these RS-domain-mediated protein interactions have been shown to occur in the spliceosome, but, rather, have all been shown by artificial protein interaction assays (i.e. two-hybrid, far westerns and so on). As a result, the mechanism by which RS domains function to activate splicing has been controversial. In 2004, the Green laboratory published two intriguing papers that provided evidence for a very different model of RS domain function 13 and 14. In the first of these papers, the authors described a creative site-specific crosslinking approach, which they used this to demonstrate that the enhancer-bound RS domain of the SR protein ASF/SF2 directly interacts with the RNA at the branchpoint in the pre-spliceosomal A complex. It wasn't so much the finding that an RS domain interacts with RNA that was so surprising – the Green laboratory had, in fact, previously shown that the RS domain of U2AF65 subunit could interact with the branchpoint [15]. Rather, it was the temporal and spatial specificity of this interaction that was so intriguing. Shen and Green have now followed up on this earlier study by showing that the ability to interact with RNA is a general property of RS domains [13]. Shen and Green extended their initial study by testing whether the RS domains of other splicing factors interact with the pre-mRNA and, if so, when and where. To do this, they used the same crosslinking approach developed in their previous study. A tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site and a FLAG epitope tag were engineered between the RS domain and the RNA-binding domain of the proteins tested. After crosslinking to a site specifically labeled pre-mRNA enriched for distinct spliceosomal complexes, the RS and RNA-binding domains were separated by TEV protease cleavage and the RS domain was immunoprecipitated with a FLAG antibody. This technique was used to test if the RS domain in question directly interacted with the pre-mRNA at a specific location. Using this approach, Shen and Green examined the progression of RS-domain–pre-mRNA interactions for U2AF65, an enhancer-bound RS domain, and an SR protein not associated with a splicing enhancer. Consistent with previous work [15], they demonstrated that the U2AF65 RS domain interacts specifically with the pre-mRNA at the branchpoint in E complex (Figure 2). However, in A complex, the U2AF65 RS domain is replaced by the enhancer-bound RS domain at the branchpoint. Moreover, in B complex, the enhancer bound RS domain no longer interacts with the branchpoint. Instead, the RS domain of a second SR protein (that is not bound to the enhancer) specifically interacts with the pre-mRNA at the 5′ splice site. Thus, throughout the course of spliceosome assembly, the RS domains of several different splicing factors sequentially interact with different sequences within the pre-mRNA. Interestingly, the timing and location of the RS-domain–pre-mRNA interactions correlate well with the timing and stabilities of snRNA–pre-mRNA interactions. The interaction of U1 snRNA with the 5′ splice site occurs early during spliceosomal assembly and is assisted by protein components of U1 snRNP. However, the U1 snRNA interaction is more extensive than the later U6 snRNA and U2 snRNA interactions with the pre-RNA [16]. Because no RS domain contacts with the 5′ splice site were detected in spliceosomal complexes containing U1 snRNP, it is likely that RS domains provide additional stabilization for weak snRNA–pre-mRNA interactions. However, because the only RS domains that could be detected were those that were added to the reaction, it is possible that an RS domain does indeed interact with and stabilize the U1 snRNA–5′ splice site. The data presented in the two papers by Shen and Green 13 and 14 leave little doubt that the RS domains of SR proteins and U2AF65 subunit engage directly in protein–RNA interactions. These observations demand a re-evaluation of RS domain function during the splicing reaction. If the described interactions are the driving forces that promote spliceosome assembly, how do RS domains accomplish this task and what is the mode by which RS domains interact with RNA? We now know that the RS domain–pre-mRNA interactions are restricted to the branchpoint sequence and the 5′ splice site – the only regions of the pre-mRNA that are directly contacted by snRNAs 13 and 14. Thus, it is likely that the RS domain of SR proteins interact with double-stranded RNA. As was originally proposed by the Green laboratory 13, 14 and 15, it is possible that the positively charged arginine residues interact with, and neutralize, the negatively charged phosphate backbone. Such an interaction could indirectly enhance the binding of the snRNA to the pre-mRNA by decreasing the electrostatic repulsion of the two stands as they come into proximity. Alternatively, or in addition, the RS domain could occupy},

Whereas PBCV-1 ligase efficiently joins a 3'-OH RNA to a 5'-phosphate DNA, it is unable to join a 3'-OH DNA to a 5'-phosphate RNA. The ligase discriminates at the substrate binding step between nicked duplexes containing 5'-phosphate DNA versus 5'-phosphate RNA strands. PBCV-1 ligase readily seals a nicked duplex DNA containing a single ribonucleotide substitution at the reactive 5'-phosphate end. These results suggest a requirement for a B-form helical conformation of the polynucleotide on the 5'-phosphate side of the nick. Single base mismatches at the nick exert disparate effects on DNA ligation efficiency. PBCV-1 ligase tolerates mismatches involving the 5'-phosphate nucleotide, with the exception of 5'-A:G and 5'-G:A mispairs, which reduce ligase activity by two orders of magnitude. Inhibitory configurations at the 3'-OH nucleotide include 3'-G:A, 3'-G:T, 3'-T:T, 3'-A:G, 3'-G:G, 3'-A:C and 3'-C:C. Our findings indicate that Chlorella virus DNA ligase has the potential to affect genome integrity by embedding ribonucleotides in viral DNA and by sealing nicked molecules with mispaired ends, thereby generating missense mutations.},

Genome-wide microarray and RNA-seq technologies have been used to profile the transcriptome of vaccinia virus (VACV), the prototype member of the family. Here, we adapted tag-based methods in conjunction with SOLiD and Illumina deep sequencing platforms to determine the precise 5' and 3' ends of VACV early mRNAs and map the putative transcription start sites (TSSs) and polyadenylation sites (PASs). Individual and clustered TSSs were found preceding 104 annotated open reading frames (ORFs), excluding pseudogenes. In the majority of cases, a 15-nucleotide consensus core motif was present upstream of the ORF. This motif, however, was also present at numerous other locations, indicating that it was insufficient for transcription initiation. Further analysis revealed a 10-nucleotide AT-rich spacer following functional core motifs that may facilitate DNA unwinding. Additional putative TSSs occurred in anomalous locations that may expand the functional repertoire of the VACV genome. However, many of the anomalous TSSs lacked an upstream core motif, raising the possibility that they arose by a processing mechanism as has been proposed for eukaryotic systems. Discrete and clustered PASs occurred about 40 nucleotides after an UUUUUNU termination signal. However, a large number of PASs were not preceded by this motif, suggesting alternative polyadenylation mechanisms. Pyrimidine-rich coding strand sequences were found immediately upstream of both types of PASs, signifying an additional feature of VACV 3'-end formation and polyadenylation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The Piwi subfamily of genes is involved in spermatogenesis for the maintenance and meiosis of germline stem cells. Mice bearing targeted mutations in Piwi genes (Miwi, Mili and Miwi2) are sterile with distinct defects in spermatogenesis. We hypothesized that Piwi gene polymorphisms could be a risk factor for spermatogenic failure.
METHODS For this study, 490 patients with idiopathic azoospermia or oligozoospermia and 468 fertile controls were recruited from an infertility clinic. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of four Piwi genes (PIWIL1/HIWI, PIWIL2/HILI, PIWIL3/HIWI3 and PIWIL4/HIWI2) were genotyped using the SNPstream® 12-plex platform and the Taqman method.
RESULTS An SNP in the 3′untranslated region of HIWI2 and a non-synonymous SNP in HIWI3 were significantly associated with an altered risk of oligozoospermia. The variant-containing genotypes of HIWI2 rs508485 exhibited a significantly increased risk, with an odds ratios (OR) of 1.49 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.02–2.18], and individuals with HIWI3 non-synonymous rs11703684 variant genotypes exhibited a significantly reduced oligozoospermia risk (OR = 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.49–1.00). The haplotype analysis showed that a common haplotype of HIWI2 was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of oligozoospermia (OR = 0.73, 95\% CI, 0.56–0.97). In addition, to assess the cumulative effects, we performed a combined unfavourable genotype analysis. A significant trend towards increased risk of oligozoospermia with an increasing number of unfavourable genotypes was observed (P for trend < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS We present the first epidemiologic evidence supporting the involvement of genetic polymorphisms in Piwi genes in spermatogenic failure.},

Here we characterize the transcriptional landscape of the four human HOX loci at five base pair resolution in 11 anatomic sites and identify 231 HOX ncRNAs that extend known transcribed regions by more than 30 kilobases. HOX ncRNAs are spatially expressed along developmental axes and possess unique sequence motifs, and their expression demarcates broad chromosomal domains of differential histone methylation and RNA polymerase accessibility. We identified a 2.2 kilobase ncRNA residing in the HOXC locus, termed HOTAIR, which represses transcription in trans across 40 kilobases of the HOXD locus. HOTAIR interacts with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and is required for PRC2 occupancy and histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation of HOXD locus. Thus, transcription of ncRNA may demarcate chromosomal domains of gene silencing at a distance; these results have broad implications for gene regulation in development and disease states.</p>},

abstract = {We report the isolation of cDNA clones for fibronectin from a rat liver library prepared in the expression vector, lambda gt11. Restriction mapping and DNA sequencing of these clones establish the sequence of the C-terminal 35\% of rat fibronectin, covering the cell-, heparin-, and fibrin-binding domains. The cell- and heparin-binding regions have homologous repeating sequences. Based on the sequence data and S1 nuclease mapping, we conclude that there are at least three different fibronectin mRNAs in rat liver which differ in coding potential. The three RNAs appear to arise by alternative splicing within the coding region and are probably all encoded by a single gene. The implications of these results for the structure and function of fibronectin and the differences between various types of fibronectin are discussed.},

abstract = {Correct gene expression patterns form the basis for male germ cell differentiation and male fertility. Although previous studies have elucidated the importance of testis specific gene expression, the exact transcripts and comprehensive gene expression patterns remain unknown. Large scale sequencing techniques have enabled cost effective analysis of gene expression and isoform studies. Using the SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencing platform we have investigated the gene expression patterns at five different time points during the first wave on murine spermatogenesis. Our results highlight the upregulation of spermatogenesis related biological processes and associated cellular components. Elucidation of differential gene expression at important time points during the sperm development emphasizes the importance of correct timing of gene expression within biological processes. Differential gene level expression was analyzed with R/Bioconductor's Limma package and isoform analysis was conducted with the Cufflinks pipeline. At gene level total of 2494 differentially expressed genes were identified and Cufflinks characterized over 160,000 gene isoforms, of which 29\% were novel transcripts assigned to known genes. Isoforms were detected for 57\% of expressed genes and in a total over 26,000 genes were expressed in the testis. Differential promoter and transcription start site usage appears also to play a role in regulation of gene expression during spermatogenesis. Furthermore, we identified 947 upregulated long non-coding RNAs during the first wave of spermatogenesis. These RNAs appeared to be highly specific to different time points. Transcriptomic analysis of testis tissue samples is highly informative due to the large number of expressed genes and identified isoforms. Our study provides a very valuable basis for investigation of gene isoforms and regulation and factors contributing to male fertility.},

DNA ligases are essential guardians of genomic integrity, and ligase dysfunction underlies human genetic disease syndromes. Crystal structures of DNA ligases bound to nucleotide and nucleic acid substrates have illuminated how ligase reaction chemistry is catalyzed, how ligases recognize damaged DNA ends, and how protein domain movements and active-site remodeling are used to choreograph the end-joining pathway. Although a shared feature of DNA ligases is their envelopment of the nicked duplex as a C-shaped protein clamp, they accomplish this feat by using remarkably different accessory structural modules and domain topologies. As structural, biochemical, and phylogenetic insights coalesce, we can expect advances on several fronts, including (i) pharmacological targeting of ligases for antibacterial and anticancer therapies and (ii) the discovery and design of new strand-sealing enzymes with unique substrate specificities.},

abstract = {Spermatogenesis, a study of germ cell development, is a long, orderly, and well-defined process occurring in seminiferous tubules of the testis. It is a temporal event whereby undifferentiated spermatogonial germ cells evolve into maturing spermatozoa over a period of several weeks. Spermatogenesis is characterized by three specific functional phases: proliferation, meiosis, and differentiation, and it involves spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids. Germ cells at steps of development form various cellular associations or stages, with 6, 12, and 14 specific stages being identified in human, mouse, and rat, respectively. The stages evolve over time in a given area of the seminiferous tubule forming a cycle of the seminiferous epithelium that has a well-defined duration for a given species. In this part, we discuss the proliferation and meiotic phase whereby spermatogonia undergo several mitotic divisions to form spermatocytes that undergo two meiotic divisions to form haploid spermatids. In the rat, spermatogonia can be subdivided into several classes: stem cells (As), proliferating cells (Apr, Aal), and differentiating cells (A1–A4, In, B). They are dependent on a specific microenvironment (niche) contributed by Sertoli, myoid, and Leydig cells for proper development. Spermatogonia possess several surface markers whereby they can be identified from each other. During meiosis, spermatocytes undergo chromosomal pairing, synapsis, and genetic exchange as well as transforming into haploid cells following meiosis. The meiotic cells form specific structural entities such as the synaptonemal complex and sex body. Many genes involved in spermatogonial renewal and the meiotic process have been identified and shown to be essential for this event. Microsc. Res. Tech., 2010. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Here, we demonstrate that a germline nuclear small RNA/chromatin pathway can maintain stable inheritance for many generations when triggered by a piRNA-dependent foreign RNA response in C. elegans. Using forward genetic screens and candidate approaches, we find that a core set of nuclear RNAi and chromatin factors is required for multigenerational inheritance of environmental RNAi and piRNA silencing. These include a germline-specific nuclear Argonaute HRDE1/WAGO-9, a HP1 ortholog HPL-2, and two putative histone methyltransferases, SET-25 and SET-32. piRNAs can trigger highly stable long-term silencing lasting at least 20 generations. Once established, this long-term memory becomes independent of the piRNA trigger but remains dependent on the nuclear RNAi/chromatin pathway. Our data present a multigenerational epigenetic inheritance mechanism induced by piRNAs.},

This problem has been formulated as finding traversals across the splice graph, which is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of gene structure and alternative splicing. In this manuscript we introduce a probabilistic formulation of the isoform reconstruction problem, and provide an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for its maximum likelihood solution. Using a series of simulated data and expressed sequences from real human genes, we demonstrate that our EM algorithm can correctly handle various situations of fragmentation and coupling in the input data.

abstract = {Alternative pre-mRNA splicing determines many changes in gene expression during development. Two regulators known to control splicing patterns during neuron and muscle differentiation are the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and its neuronal homolog nPTB. These proteins repress certain exons in early myoblasts, but upon differentiation of mature myotubes PTB/nPTB expression is reduced, leading to increased inclusion of their target exons. We show here that the repression of nPTB expression during myoblast differentiation results from its targeting by the muscle-restricted microRNA miR-133. During differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, nPTB protein but not mRNA expression is strongly reduced, concurrent with the up-regulation of miR-133 and the induction of splicing for several PTB-repressed exons. Introduction of synthetic miR-133 into undifferentiated C2C12 cells leads to a decrease in endogenous nPTB expression. Both the miR-133 and the coexpressed miR-1/206 microRNAs are extremely conserved across animal species, and PTB proteins are predicted targets for these miRNAs in Drosophila, mice, and humans. There are two potential miR-133-responsive elements (MRE) within the nPTB 3' untranslated region (UTR), and a luciferase reporter carrying this 3' UTR is repressed by miR-133 in an MRE-dependent manner. Transfection of locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotides designed to block the function of miR-133 and miR-1/206 increases expression of nPTB and decreases the inclusion of PTB dependent exons. These results indicate that miR-133 directly down-regulates a key splicing factor during muscle development and establishes a role for microRNAs in the control of a developmentally dynamic splicing program.},

Animals lacking piRNA functions show defects in gametogenesis and exhibit sterility. Their descendants are also predisposed to inheriting mutations. Thus, the piRNA pathway has evolved to repress transposons post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally. A growing number of studies on piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA biogenesis. However, piRNAs remain the most enigmatic among all of the silencing-inducing small RNAs because of their complexity and uniqueness. Although piRNAs have been previously suggested to be germline-specific, recent studies have shown that piRNAs also play crucial roles in nongonadal cells. Furthermore, piRNAs have also recently been shown to have roles in multigenerational epigenetic phenomena in worms.

piRNAs guide PIWI proteins to silence transposons in animal germ cells. Reciprocal cycles of piRNA-directed RNA cleavage—catalyzed by the PIWI proteins Aubergine (Aub) and Argonaute3 (Ago3) in Drosophila melanogaster—expand the population of antisense piRNAs in response to transposon expression, a process called the Ping-Pong cycle. Heterotypic Ping-Pong between Aub and Ago3 ensures that antisense piRNAs predominate. We show that qin, a piRNA pathway gene whose protein product contains both E3 ligase and Tudor domains, colocalizes with Aub and Ago3 in nuage, a perinuclear structure implicated in transposon silencing. In qin mutants, less Ago3 binds Aub, futile Aub:Aub homotypic Ping-Pong prevails, antisense piRNAs decrease, many families of mobile genetic elements are reactivated, and DNA damage accumulates in nurse cells and oocytes. We propose that Qin enforces heterotypic Ping-Pong between Aub and Ago3, ensuring that transposons are silenced and maintaining the integrity of the germline genome.},

abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

abstract = {Regulation of alternative splicing is controlled by pre-mRNA sequences (cis-elements) and trans-acting protein factors that bind them. The combinatorial interactions of multiple protein factors with the cis-elements surrounding a given alternative splicing event lead to an integrated splicing decision. The mechanism of multifactorial splicing regulation is poorly understood. Using a splicing-sensitive DNA microarray, we assayed 352 Caenorhabditis elegans alternative cassette exons for changes in embryonic splicing patterns between wild-type and 12 different strains carrying mutations in a splicing factor. We identified many alternative splicing events that are regulated by multiple splicing factors. Many splicing factors have the ability to behave as splicing repressors for some alternative cassette exons and as splicing activators for others. Unexpectedly, we found that the ability of a given alternative splicing factor to behave as an enhancer or repressor of a specific splicing event can change during development. Our observations that splicing factors can change their effects on a substrate during development support a model in which combinatorial effects of multiple factors, both constitutive and developmentally regulated ones, contribute to the overall splicing decision.},

abstract = {The Tudor domain-containing proteins (TDRDs) are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins involved in germ cell development. We show here that in mice, TDRD5 is a novel component of the intermitochondrial cements (IMCs) and the chromatoid bodies (CBs), which are cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules involved in RNA processing for spermatogenesis. Tdrd5-deficient males are sterile because of spermiogenic arrest at the round spermatid stage, with occasional failure in meiotic prophase. Without TDRD5, IMCs and CBs are disorganized, with mislocalization of their key components, including TDRD1/6/7/9 and MIWI/MILI/MIWI2. In addition, Tdrd5-deficient germ cells fail to repress LINE-1 retrotransposons with DNA-demethylated promoters. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element modulator (CREM) and TRF2, key transcription factors for spermiogenesis, are expressed in Tdrd5-deficient round spermatids, but their targets, including Prm1/Prm2/Tnp1, are severely down-regulated, which indicates the importance of IMC/CB-mediated regulation for postmeiotic gene expression. Strikingly, Tdrd5-deficient round spermatids injected into oocytes contribute to fertile offspring, demonstrating that acquisition of a functional haploid genome may be uncoupled from TDRD5 function.},

abstract = {This article describes a method for the global profiling of the substrate specificities of DNA ligases and illustrates examples using the Taq and T4 DNA ligases. The method combines oligonucleotide arrays, which offer the benefits of high throughput and multiplexed assays, with mass spectrometry to permit label-free assays of ligase activity. Arrays were prepared by immobilizing ternary biotin-tagged DNA substrates to a self-assembled monolayer presenting a layer of streptavidin protein. The array represented complexes having all possible matched and mismatched base pairs at the 3′ side of the nick site and also included a number of deletions and insertions at this site. The arrays were treated with ligases and adenosine triphosphate or analogs of the nucleotide triphosphate and then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry to determine the yields for both adenylation of the 5′-probe strand and joining of the two probe strands. The resulting activity profiles reveal the basis for specificity of the ligases and also point to strategies that use ATP analogs to improve specificity. This work introduces a method that can be applied to profile a broad range of enzymes that operate on nucleic acid substrates.},

abstract = {The mouse Piwi family proteins (MILI, MIWI and MIWI2) play pivotal roles in spermatogenesis through transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation. To reveal the molecular functions of these proteins, we investigate the proteins that bind to MILI in adult mouse testes. We found that both MILI and MIWI bind to TDRD1/MTR-1, which is also an essential protein for spermatogenesis. Co-immunoprecipitation assays and subcellular localization of the proteins and mutants thereof revealed a complex formation involving MILI, MIWI and TDRD1/MTR-1. In addition, the subcellular localizations of MILI and TDRD1/MTR-1 were altered, and chromatoid body formation was impaired in the MIWI-null round spermatids. These data suggest that the formation of complexes between MILI, MIWI and TDRD1/MTR-1 is critical for the integrated subcellular localizations of these proteins, and is presumably essential for spermatogenesis.},

abstract = {Staufen 1 (STAU1)-mediated messenger RNA decay (SMD) involves the degradation of translationally active mRNAs whose 3'-untranslated regions (3' UTRs) bind to STAU1, a protein that binds to double-stranded RNA. Earlier studies defined the STAU1-binding site within ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) mRNA as a 19-base-pair stem with a 100-nucleotide apex. However, we were unable to identify comparable structures in the 3' UTRs of other targets of SMD. Here we show that STAU1-binding sites can be formed by imperfect base-pairing between an Alu element in the 3' UTR of an SMD target and another Alu element in a cytoplasmic, polyadenylated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). An individual lncRNA can downregulate a subset of SMD targets, and distinct lncRNAs can downregulate the same SMD target. These are previously unappreciated functions of non-coding RNAs and Alu elements. Not all mRNAs that contain an Alu element in the 3' UTR are targeted for SMD even in the presence of a complementary lncRNA that targets other mRNAs for SMD. Most known trans-acting RNA effectors consist of fewer than 200 nucleotides, and these include small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs. Our finding that the binding of STAU1 to mRNAs can be transactivated by lncRNAs uncovers an unexpected strategy that cells use to recruit proteins to mRNAs and mediate the decay of these mRNAs. We name these lncRNAs half-STAU1-binding site RNAs (1/2-sbsRNAs).},

abstract = {Desert locusts show an extreme form of phenotypic plasticity, changing between a cryptic solitarious phase and a swarming gregarious phase that differ in many aspects of behaviour, physiology and appearance. Solitarious locusts show rapid behavioural phase change in response to tactile stimulation directed to the hind femora. Repeatedly touching as little as one quarter of the anterior (outer) surface area of a hind femur produced full behavioural gregarization within 4 h. Solitarious locusts have approximately 30\% more mechanosensory trichoid sensilla on the hind femora than do gregarious locusts but have similar or fewer numbers of sensilla elsewhere on the legs. Tactile stimulation of a hind femur in solitarious locusts that had been restrained so that they could not move their legs failed to induce any behavioural gregarization. Patterned electrical stimulation of metathoracic nerve 5, which innervates the hind leg, however, produced full gregarization in restrained locusts. Our data show for the first time that the gregarizing signal combines both exteroceptive and proprioceptive components, which travel in both nerves \{5B1\} and \{5B2,\} and provides us with a powerful experimental method with which to elicit and study neuronal plasticity in this system. Acetic acid odour, a strong chemosensory stimulus that activates the same local processing pathways as exteroceptive stimuli, failed to elicit behavioural gregarization, suggesting an early segregation in the central nervous system of the mechanosensory signals that leads to gregarization.},

abstract = {Mechanistic analysis of transcriptional initiation and termination by RNA polymerase II (PolII) indicates that some factors are common to both processes. Here we show that two long genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, FMP27 and SEN1, exist in a looped conformation, effectively bringing together their promoter and terminator regions. We also show that PolII is located at both ends of FMP27 when this gene is transcribed from a GAL1 promoter under induced and noninduced conditions. Under these conditions, the C-terminal domain of the large subunit of PolII is phosphorylated at Ser5. Notably, inactivation of Kin28p causes a loss of both Ser5 phosphorylation and the loop conformation. These data suggest that gene loops are involved in the early stages of transcriptional activation. They also predict a previously unknown structural dimension to gene regulation, in which both ends of the transcription unit are defined before and during the transcription cycle.},

abstract = {Ultra-high-throughput sequencing is emerging as an attractive alternative to microarrays for genotyping, analysis of methylation patterns, and identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study mRNA expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

abstract = {The ATP-dependent chromatin assembly and remodelling factor (ACF) functions to generate regularly spaced nucleosomes, which are required for heritable gene silencing. The mechanism by which ACF mobilizes nucleosomes remains poorly understood. Here we report a single-molecule FRET study that monitors the remodelling of individual nucleosomes by ACF in real time, revealing previously unknown remodelling intermediates and dynamics. In the presence of ACF and ATP, the nucleosomes exhibit gradual translocation along DNA interrupted by well-defined kinetic pauses that occurred after approximately seven or three to four base pairs of translocation. The binding of ACF, translocation of DNA and exiting of translocation pauses are all ATP-dependent, revealing three distinct functional roles of ATP during remodelling. At equilibrium, a continuously bound ACF complex can move the nucleosome back-and-forth many times before dissociation, indicating that ACF is a highly processive and bidirectional nucleosome translocase.},

@article{Close2012,
abstract = {Alternative messenger RNA splicing is the main reason that vast mammalian proteomic complexity can be achieved with a limited number of genes. Splicing is physically and functionally coupled to transcription, and is greatly affected by the rate of transcript elongation. As the nascent pre-mRNA emerges from transcribing RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), it is assembled into a messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particle; this is the functional form of the nascent pre-mRNA and determines the fate of the mature transcript. However, factors that connect the transcribing polymerase with the mRNP particle and help to integrate transcript elongation with mRNA splicing remain unclear. Here we characterize the human interactome of chromatin-associated mRNP particles. This led us to identify deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) and ZNF326 (which we call ZNF-protein interacting with nuclear mRNPs and DBC1 (ZIRD)) as subunits of a novel protein complex[mdash]named DBIRD[mdash]that binds directly to RNAPII. DBIRD regulates alternative splicing of a large set of exons embedded in (A + T)-rich DNA, and is present at the affected exons. RNA-interference-mediated DBIRD depletion results in region-specific decreases in transcript elongation, particularly across areas encompassing affected exons. Together, these data indicate that the DBIRD complex acts at the interface between mRNP particles and RNAPII, integrating transcript elongation with the regulation of alternative splicing.},

Here, we present a ribosome-profiling strategy that is based on the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments and enables genome-wide investigation of translation with subcodon resolution. We used this technique to monitor translation in budding yeast under both rich and starvation conditions. These studies defined the protein sequences being translated and found extensive translational control in both determining absolute protein abundance and responding to environmental stress. We also observed distinct phases during translation that involve a large decrease in ribosome density going from early to late peptide elongation as well as widespread regulated initiation at non-adenine-uracil-guanine (AUG) codons. Ribosome profiling is readily adaptable to other organisms, making high-precision investigation of protein translation experimentally accessible.},

@article{Aravin2008a,
abstract = {During the past several years, it has become clear that small RNAs guard germ cell genomes from the activity of mobile genetic elements. Indeed, in mammals, a class of small RNAs, known as Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), forms an innate immune system that discriminates transposons from endogenous genes and selectively silences the former. piRNAs enforce silencing by directing transposon DNA methylation during male germ cell development. As such, piRNAs represent perhaps the only currently known sequence-specific factor for deposition of methylcytosine in mammals. The three mammalian Piwi proteins Miwi2, Mili, and Miwi are required at different stages of germ cell development. Moreover, distinct classes of piRNAs are expressed in developmental waves, with particular generative loci and different sequence content distinguishing piRNAs populations in embryonic germ cells from those that appear during meiosis. Although our understanding of Piwi proteins and piRNA biology have deepened substantially during the last several years, major gaps still exist in our understanding of these enigmatic RNA species.},

@article{Marden2008,
abstract = {A fundamental feature of gene expression in multicellular organisms is the production of distinct transcripts from single genes by alternative splicing (AS), which amplifies protein and functional diversity. In spite of the likely consequences for organismal biology, little is known about how AS varies among individuals or responds to body condition, environmental variation or extracellular signals in general. Here we show that evolutionarily conserved AS of troponin-t in flight muscle of adult moths responds in a quantitative fashion to experimental manipulation of larval nutrition and adult body weight. Troponin-t (Tnt) isoform composition is known to affect muscle force and power output in other animals, and is shown here to be associated with the thorax mass-specific rate of energy consumption during flight. Loading of adults with external weights for 5 days caused an AS response nearly identical to equal increases in actual body weight. In addition, there were effects of larval feeding history on adult Tnt isoform composition that were independent of body weight, with moths from poorer larval feeding regimes producing isoform profiles associated with reduced muscle performance and energy consumption rate. Thus, Tnt isoform composition in striated muscle is responsive to both weight-sensing and nutrition-sensing mechanisms, with consequent effects on function. In free-living butterflies, Tnt isoform composition was also associated with activity level and very strongly with the rate of egg production. Overall, these results show that AS of a muscle gene responds in a quantitative fashion to whole-organism variables, which apparently serves to coordinate muscle strength and energy expenditure with body condition and life history.},

@article{Hosokawa2007,
abstract = {The germ-line cells of many animals possess a characteristic cytoplasmic structure termed nuage or germinal granules. In mice, nuage that is prominent in postnatal male germ cells is also called intermitochondrial cement or chromatoid bodies. TDRD1/MTR-1, which contains Tudor domain repeats, is a specific component of the mouse nuage, analogously to Drosophila Tudor, a constituent of polar granules/nuage in oocytes and embryos. We show that TDRD6 and TDRD7/TRAP, which also contain multiple Tudor domains, specifically localize to nuage and form a ribonucleoprotein complex together with TDRD1/MTR-1. The characteristic co-localization of TDRD1, 6 and 7 was disrupted in a mutant of mouse vasa homologue/DEAD box polypeptide 4 (Mvh/Ddx4), which encodes another evolutionarily conserved component of nuage. In vivo over-expression experiments of the TDRD proteins and truncated forms during male germ cell differentiation showed that a single Tudor domain is a structural unit that localizes or accumulates to nuage, but the expression of the truncated, putative dominant negative forms is detrimental to meiotic spermatocytes. These results indicate that the Tudor-related proteins, which contain multiple repeats of the Tudor domain, constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of nuage components in the germ-line, and their localization or accumulation to nuage is likely conferred by a Tudor domain structure and downstream of Mvh, while the characteristic repeated architecture of the domain is functionally essential for the differentiation of germ cells.},

abstract = {A family of highly polymorphic neuronal cell surface proteins, the neurexins, has been identified. At least two genes for neurexins exist. Each gene uses alternative promoters and multiple variably spliced exons to potentially generate more than a 100 different neurexin transcripts. The neurexins were discovered by the identification of one member of the family as the receptor for alpha-latrotoxin. This toxin is a component of the venom from black widow spiders; it binds to presynaptic nerve terminals and triggers massive neurotransmitter release. Neurexins contain single transmembrane regions and extracellular domains with repeated sequences similar to sequences in laminin A, slit, and agrin, proteins that have been implicated in axon guidance and synaptogenesis. An antibody to neurexin I showed highly concentrated immunoreactivity at the synapse. The polymorphic structure of the neurexins, their neural localization, and their sequence similarity to proteins associated with neurogenesis suggest a function as cell recognition molecules in the nerve terminal.},

Now, thanks to improved genome-scale mapping of methylation, we can evaluate DNA methylation in different genomic contexts: transcriptional start sites with or without CpG islands, in gene bodies, at regulatory elements and at repeat sequences. The emerging picture is that the function of DNA methylation seems to vary with context, and the relationship between DNA methylation and transcription is more nuanced than we realized at first. Improving our understanding of the functions of DNA methylation is necessary for interpreting changes in this mark that are observed in diseases such as cancer.},

CAGE allows high-throughout gene expression analysis and the profiling of transcriptional start points (TSP), including promoter usage analysis. By analyzing four libraries (brain, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum), we redefined more accurately the TSPs of 11-27\% of the analyzed transcriptional units that were hit. The frequency of CAGE tags correlates well with results from other analyses, such as serial analysis of gene expression, and furthermore maps the TSPs more accurately, including in tissue-specific cases. The high-throughput nature of this technology paves the way for understanding gene networks via correlation of promoter usage and gene transcriptional factor expression.},

abstract = {Many large noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate chromatin, but the mechanisms by which they localize to genomic targets remain unexplored. Here, we investigate the localization mechanisms of the Xist lncRNA during X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), a paradigm of lncRNA-mediated chromatin regulation. During the maintenance of XCI, Xist binds broadly across the X-chromosome. During initiation of XCI, Xist initially transfers to distal regions across the X-chromosome that are not defined by specific sequences. Instead, Xist identifies these regions by exploiting the three-dimensional conformation of the X-chromosome. Xist requires its silencing domain to spread across actively transcribed regions and thereby access the entire chromosome. This suggests a model where Xist coats the X-chromosome by searching in three dimensions, modifying chromosome structure, and spreading to newly accessible locations.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs is an important mechanism for generating proteome diversity and regulating gene expression. The Drosophila melanogaster Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (Dscam) gene is an extreme example of mutually exclusive splicing. Dscam contains 95 alternatively spliced exons that potentially encode 38,016 distinct mRNA and protein isoforms. We previously identified two sets of conserved sequence elements, the docking site and selector sequences in the Dscam exon 6 cluster, which contains 48 mutually exclusive exons. These elements were proposed to engage in competing RNA secondary structures required for mutually exclusive splicing, though this model has not yet been experimentally tested. Here we describe a new system that allowed us to demonstrate that the docking site and selector sequences are indeed required for exon 6 mutually exclusive splicing and that the strength of these RNA structures determines the frequency of exon 6 inclusion. We also show that the function of the docking site has been conserved for ∼500 million years of evolution. This work demonstrates that conserved intronic sequences play a functional role in mutually exclusive splicing of the Dscam exon 6 cluster.},

abstract = {The vast non-coding portion of the human genome is full of functional elements and disease-causing regulatory variants. The principles defining the relationships between these elements and distal target genes remain unknown. Promoters and distal elements can engage in looping interactions that have been implicated in gene regulation. Here we have applied chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) to interrogate comprehensively interactions between transcription start sites (TSSs) and distal elements in 1\% of the human genome representing the ENCODE pilot project regions. 5C maps were generated for GM12878, K562 and HeLa-S3 cells and results were integrated with data from the ENCODE consortium. In each cell line we discovered >1,000 long-range interactions between promoters and distal sites that include elements resembling enhancers, promoters and CTCF-bound sites. We observed significant correlations between gene expression, promoter-enhancer interactions and the presence of enhancer RNAs. Long-range interactions show marked asymmetry with a bias for interactions with elements located [sim]120 kilobases upstream of the TSS. Long-range interactions are often not blocked by sites bound by CTCF and cohesin, indicating that many of these sites do not demarcate physically insulated gene domains. Furthermore, only [sim]7\% of looping interactions are with the nearest gene, indicating that genomic proximity is not a simple predictor for long-range interactions. Finally, promoters and distal elements are engaged in multiple long-range interactions to form complex networks. Our results start to place genes and regulatory elements in three-dimensional context, revealing their functional relationships.},

abstract = {An intronic hexanucleotide UGCAUG has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of tissue-specific alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs in a wide range of tissues. Vertebrate Fox-1 has been shown to bind to this element, in a highly sequence-specific manner, through its RNA recognition motif (RRM). In mammals, there are at least two Fox-1-related genes, ataxin-2 binding protein 1 (A2BP1)/Fox-1 and Fxh/Rbm9, which encode an identical RRM. Here, we demonstrate that both mouse Fxh and A2BP1 transcripts undergo tissue-specific alternative splicing, generating protein isoforms specific to brain and muscle. These tissue-specific isoforms are characterized for their abilities to regulate neural cell-specific alternative splicing of a cassette exon, N30, in the non-muscle myosin heavy chain II-B pre-mRNA, previously shown to be regulated through an intronic distal downstream enhancer (IDDE). All Fxh and A2BP1 isoforms with the RRM are capable of binding to the IDDE in vitro through the UGCAUG elements. Each isoform, however, shows quantitative differences in splicing activity and nuclear distribution in transfected cells. All Fxh isoforms and a brain isoform of A2BP1 show a predominant nuclear localization. Brain isoforms of both Fxh and A2BP1 promote N30 splicing much more efficiently than do the muscle-specific isoforms. Skeletal muscles express additional isoforms that lack a part of the RRM. These isoforms are incapable of activating neural cell-specific splicing and, moreover, can inhibit UGCAUG-dependent N30 splicing. These findings suggest that tissue-specific isoforms of Fxh and A2BP1 play an important role in determining tissue specificity of UGCAUG-mediated alternative splicing.},

The presence of ribonucleotides in genomic DNA is undesirable given their increased susceptibility to hydrolysis. Ribonuclease (RNase) H enzymes that recognize and process such embedded ribonucleotides are present in all domains of life. However, in unicellular organisms such as budding yeast, they are not required for viability or even efficient cellular proliferation, while in humans, RNase H2 hypomorphic mutations cause the neuroinflammatory disorder Aicardi-Gouti\`{e}res syndrome. Here, we report that RNase H2 is an essential enzyme in mice, required for embryonic growth from gastrulation onward. RNase H2 null embryos accumulate large numbers of single (or di-) ribonucleotides embedded in their genomic DNA (\&gt;1,000,000 per cell), resulting in genome instability and a p53-dependent DNA-damage response. Our findings establish RNase H2 as a key mammalian genome surveillance enzyme required for ribonucleotide removal and demonstrate that ribonucleotides are the most commonly occurring endogenous nucleotide base lesion in replicating cells.},

The mechanism involved in this coupling is not known. To identify potential coupling factors, we carried out a comprehensive proteomic analysis of immunopurified human RNAP II, identifying >100 specifically associated proteins. Among these are the SR protein family of splicing factors and all of the components of U1 snRNP, but no other snRNPs or splicing factors. We show that SR proteins function in coupling transcription to splicing and provide evidence that the mechanism involves cotranscriptional recruitment of SR proteins to RNAP II transcripts. We propose that the exclusive association of U1 snRNP/SR proteins with RNAP II positions these splicing factors, which are known to function early in spliceosome assembly, close to the nascent pre-mRNA. Thus, these factors readily out-compete inhibitory hnRNP proteins, resulting in efficient spliceosome assembly on nascent RNAP II transcripts.},

Sequences of the free ends of the cloned templates on each microbead were then simultaneously analyzed using a fluorescence-based signature sequencing method that does not require DNA fragment separation. Signature sequences of 16-20 bases were obtained by repeated cycles of enzymatic cleavage with a type IIs restriction endonuclease, adaptor ligation, and sequence interrogation by encoded hybridization probes. The approach was validated by sequencing over 269,000 signatures from two cDNA libraries constructed from a fully sequenced strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and by measuring gene expression levels in the human cell line THP-1. The approach provides an unprecedented depth of analysis permitting application of powerful statistical techniques for discovery of functional relationships among genes, whether known or unknown beforehand, or whether expressed at high or very low levels.},

abstract = {We have designed a novel approach using genetically engineered mice to make a systematic study of the EDA exon regulation of the fibronectin gene during development and aging. The genome of the mice was modified either by optimization of the EDA natural splice sites or by deleting the EDA region. The previous in vitro observation that the optimization of the splicing sites leads to constitutive inclusion of the EDA exon was confirmed in our animal model. In fact, all the adult tissues of the genetically modified mice showed only EDA(+) FN mRNA, demonstrating the fidelity of in vitro models, despite of the development- and aging-regulated splicing regulation of the EDA exon, and regardless of the presence of exonic elements described within the exon. This result indicates that the splicing regulatory elements of the EDA exon are dispensable in the presence of consensus splicing sites. Moreover, we demonstrate the autonomy of both the EDB and the IIICS alternatively spliced regions in adult mice lacking regulation of the alternative splicing at the EDA exon. We also show here the tight splicing regulation of all three alternative spliced regions of the FN gene at different time-points during development and aging of mice.},

abstract = {Gene expression in multiple individual cells from a tissue or culture sample varies according to cell-cycle, genetic, epigenetic and stochastic differences between the cells. However, single-cell differences have been largely neglected in the analysis of the functional consequences of genetic variation. Here we measure the expression of 92 genes affected by Wnt signaling in 1,440 single cells from 15 individuals to associate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with gene-expression phenotypes, while accounting for stochastic and cell-cycle differences between cells. We provide evidence that many heritable variations in gene function-such as burst size, burst frequency, cell cycle-specific expression and expression correlation/noise between cells-are masked when expression is averaged over many cells. Our results demonstrate how single-cell analyses provide insights into the mechanistic and network effects of genetic variability, with improved statistical power to model these effects on gene expression.},

abstract = {Desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, show extreme phenotypic plasticity, transforming between a little-seen solitarious phase and the notorious swarming gregarious phase depending on population density. An essential tipping point in the process of swarm formation is the initial switch from strong mutual aversion in solitarious locusts to coherent group formation and greater activity in gregarious locusts. We show here that serotonin, an evolutionarily conserved mediator of neuronal plasticity, is responsible for this behavioral transformation, being both necessary if behavioral gregarization is to occur and sufficient to induce it. Our data demonstrate a neurochemical mechanism linking interactions between individuals to large-scale changes in population structure and the onset of mass migration.},

abstract = {In germ cells, Piwi proteins interact with a specific class of small noncoding RNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Together, these form a pathway that represses transposable elements, thus safeguarding germ cell genomes. Basic models describe the overall operation of piRNA pathways. However, the protein compositions of Piwi complexes, the critical protein-protein interactions that drive small RNA production and target recognition, and the precise molecular consequences of conserved localization to germline structures, call nuage, remains poorly understood. We purified the three murine Piwi family proteins, MILI, MIWI, and MIWI2, from mouse germ cells and characterized their interacting protein partners. Piwi proteins were found in complex with PRMT5/WDR77, an enzyme that dimethylates arginine residues. By immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies and by mass spectrometry, we found that Piwi proteins are arginine methylated at conserved positions in their N termini. These modifications are essential to direct complex formation with specific members of the Tudor protein family. Recognition of methylarginine marks by Tudor proteins can drive the localization of Piwi proteins to cytoplasmic foci in an artificial setting, supporting a role for this interaction in Piwi localization to nuage, a characteristic that correlates with proper operation of the piRNA pathway and transposon silencing in multiple organisms.},

These changes also accumulate across generations through a maternal effect. Female desert locusts alter the developmental trajectory of their offspring in response to their own experience of crowding. The mother possesses a memory of both the recency and extent of crowding and shifts the phase state of her hatchlings accordingly. Extensive experimental work has shown that offspring behaviour is controlled by a low molecular weight, polar compound (or compounds) released from the mother's accessory glands. The chemical identity of this agent is not yet known.},

abstract = {<p><br/>Background: The injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) has been shown to induce a potent sequence-specific inhibition of gene function in diverse invertebrate and vertebrate species. The homology-dependent posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) caused by the introduction of transgenes in plants may be mediated by dsRNA. The analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans mutants impaired with dsRNA-mediated silencing and studies in plants implicate a biological role of dsRNA-mediated silencing as a transposon-repression and antiviral mechanism.<br/>Results: We investigated the silencing of testis-expressed Stellate genes by paralogous Su(Ste) tandem repeats, which are known to be involved in the maintenance of male fertility in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that both strands of repressor Su(Ste) repeats are transcribed, producing sense and antisense RNA. The Stellate silencing is associated with the presence of short Su(Ste) RNAs. Cotransfection experiments revealed that Su(Ste) dsRNA can target and eliminate Stellate transcripts in Drosophila cell culture. The short fragment of Stellate gene that is homologous to Su(Ste) was shown to be sufficient to confer Su(Ste)-dependent silencing of a reporter construct in testes. We demonstrated that Su(Ste) dsRNA-mediated silencing affects not only Stellate expression but also the level of sense Su(Ste) RNA providing a negative autogenous regulation of Su(Ste) expression. Mutation in the spindle-E gene relieving Stellate silencing also leads to a derepression of the other genomic tandem repeats and retrotransposons in the germline.<br/>Conclusions: Homology-dependent gene silencing was shown to be used to inhibit Stellate gene expression in the D. melanogaster germline, ensuring male fertility. dsRNA-mediated silencing may provide a basis for negative autogenous control of gene expression. The related surveillance system is implicated to control expression of retrotransposons in the germline.</p>},

However, many piRNA species lack obvious sequence complementarity to transposons or other loci; only one C. elegans transposon is a known piRNA target. Here, we show that, in mutants lacking the Piwi Argonaute PRG-1 (and consequently its associated piRNAs/21U-RNAs), many silent loci in the germline exhibit increased levels of mRNA expression with a concomitant depletion of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)-derived secondary small RNAs termed 22G-RNAs. Sequences depleted of 22G-RNAs are proximal to potential target sites that base pair imperfectly but extensively to 21U-RNAs. We show that PRG-1 is required to initiate, but not to maintain, silencing of transgenes engineered to contain complementarity to endogenous 21U-RNAs. Our findings support a model in which C. elegans piRNAs utilize their enormous repertoire of targeting capacity to scan the germline transcriptome for foreign sequences, while endogenous germline-expressed genes are actively protected from piRNA-induced silencing.},

\#\#\# Abstract quotes:

        
>This study (1) investigates the effect of different genome annotations on RNA-seq quantification and (2) provides guidelines for choosing a genome annotation based on research focus.

        
>In the mapping stage, the least complex genome annotation, RefSeq Genes, appears to have the highest percentage of uniquely mapped short sequence reads. In the quantification stage, RefSeq Genes results in the most stable expression estimates in terms of the average coefficient of variation over all genes. Stable expression estimates in the quantification stage translate to accurate statistics for detecting differentially expressed genes. We observe that RefSeq Genes produces the most accurate fold-change measures with respect to a ground truth of RT-qPCR gene expression estimates.

        
>However, simpler genome annotations may limit opportunities for identifying or characterizing novel transcriptional or regulatory mechanisms. When conducting research that aims to be more exploratory, a more complex genome annotation may be preferred.

        
\#\#\# And the *take home*:

        
>Thus, when comparing RNA-seq fold-change statistics to ground truth RT-qPCR fold-change statis- tics, more complex annotations tend to have larger deviation and smaller correlation. In summary, the impact of genome annotation choice on RNA-seq expression estimates is significant, and the choice of annotation should depend on the study. Less complex genome annotations are preferable for studies that requiremorestableRNA-seq expressionestimates. However, to discover and explain unknown biological mechanisms, more comprehensive and complex genome annotations are necessary.

abstract = {The Drosophila muscle myosin heavy chain (Mhc) gene primary transcript contains five alternatively spliced exon groups (exon 3, 7, 9, 11 and 15), each of which contains two to five mutually exclusive members. Individual muscles typically select a specific alternative exon from each group for incorporation into the processed message. We report here on the cis-regulatory mechanisms that direct the processing of alternative exons in Mhc exon 11 in individual muscles using transgenic reporter constructs, RT-PCR and directed mutagenesis. The 6.0-kilobase exon 11 domain is sufficient to direct the correct processing of exon 11 alternatives, demonstrating that the alternative splicing cis-regulatory elements are local to Mhc exon 11. Mutational analysis of Mhc exon 11 reveals that the alternative exon nonconsensus 5'-splice donors are essential for alternative splicing regulation in general, but do not specify alternative exons for inclusion in individual muscles. Rather, we show, through exon substitutions and deletion analyses, that a 360-nucleotide intronic domain precisely directs the normal processing of one exon, Mhc exon 11e, in the indirect flight muscle. These and other data indicate that alternative exons are regulated in appropriate muscles through interactions between intronic alternative splice-specificity elements, nonconsensus exon 11 splice donors and, likely, novel exon-specific alternative splicing factors.},

abstract = {Splicing in vitro of a messenger RNA (mRNA) precursor (pre-mRNA) is inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to the C proteins (anti-C) of the heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA)-ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) particles. This antibody, 4F4, inhibits an early step of the reaction: cleavage at the 3' end of the upstream exon and the formation of the intron lariat. In contrast, boiled 4F4, or a different monoclonal antibody (designated 2B12) to the C proteins, or antibodies to other hnRNP proteins (120 and 68 kilodaltons) and nonimmune mouse antibodies have no inhibitory effect. The 4F4 antibody does not prevent the adenosine triphosphate-dependent formation of a 60S splicing complex (spliceosome). Furthermore, the 60S splicing complex contains C proteins, and it can be immunoprecipitated with 4F4. Depletion of C proteins from the splicing extract by immunoadsorption with either of the two monoclonal antibodies to the C proteins (4F4 or 2B12) results in the loss of splicing activity, whereas mock-depletion with nonimmune mouse antibodies bodies has no effect. A 60S splicing complex does not form in a C protein-depleted nuclear extract. These results indicate an essential role for proteins of the hnRNP complex in the splicing of mRNA precursors.},

Epidemiologic studies in humans have demonstrated that endurance training reduces the risk of chronic diseases and extends life expectancy. Whether endurance exercise can attenuate the cumulative systemic decline observed in aging remains elusive. Here we show that 5 mo of endurance exercise induced systemic mitochondrial biogenesis, prevented mtDNA depletion and mutations, increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity and respiratory chain assembly, restored mitochondrial morphology, and blunted pathological levels of apoptosis in multiple tissues of mtDNA mutator mice. These adaptations conferred complete phenotypic protection, reduced multisystem pathology, and prevented premature mortality in these mice. The systemic mitochondrial rejuvenation through endurance exercise promises to be an effective therapeutic approach to mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and related comorbidities.},

abstract = {SR proteins are well-characterized RNA binding proteins that promote exon inclusion by binding to exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs). However, it has been unclear whether regulatory rules deduced on model genes apply generally to activities of SR proteins in the cell. Here, we report global analyses of two prototypical SR proteins, SRSF1 (SF2/ASF) and SRSF2 (SC35), using splicing-sensitive arrays and CLIP-seq on mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). Unexpectedly, we find that these SR proteins promote both inclusion and skipping of exons in vivo, but their binding patterns do not explain such opposite responses. Further analyses reveal that loss of one SR protein is accompanied by coordinated loss or compensatory gain in the interaction of other SR proteins at the affected exons. Therefore, specific effects on regulated splicing by one SR protein actually depend on a complex set of relationships with multiple other SR proteins in mammalian genomes.},

abstract = {The evolutionarily conserved Argonaute/PIWI (AGO/PIWI, also known as PAZ-PIWI domain or PPD) family of proteins is crucial for the biogenesis and function of small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). This family can be divided into AGO and PIWI subfamilies. The AGO proteins are ubiquitously present in diverse tissues. They bind to small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). In contrast, the PIWI proteins are predominantly present in the germline and associate with a novel class of small RNAs known as PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Tens of thousands of piRNA species, typically 24-32 nucleotide (nt) long, have been found in mammals, zebrafish, and Drosophila. Most piRNAs appear to be generated from a small number of long single-stranded RNA precursors that are often encoded by repetitive intergenic sequences in the genome. PIWI proteins play crucial roles during germline development and gametogenesis of many metazoan species, from germline determination and germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance to meiosis, spermiogenesis, and transposon silencing. These diverse functions may involve piRNAs and may be achieved via novel mechanisms of epigenetic and posttranscriptional regulation.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing has a crucial role in the generation of biological complexity, and its misregulation is often involved in human disease. Here we describe the assembly of a 'splicing code', which uses combinations of hundreds of RNA features to predict tissue-dependent changes in alternative splicing for thousands of exons. The code determines new classes of splicing patterns, identifies distinct regulatory programs in different tissues, and identifies mutation-verified regulatory sequences. Widespread regulatory strategies are revealed, including the use of unexpectedly large combinations of features, the establishment of low exon inclusion levels that are overcome by features in specific tissues, the appearance of features deeper into introns than previously appreciated, and the modulation of splice variant levels by transcript structure characteristics. The code detected a class of exons whose inclusion silences expression in adult tissues by activating nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay, but whose exclusion promotes expression during embryogenesis. The code facilitates the discovery and detailed characterization of regulated alternative splicing events on a genome-wide scale.},

Recent high-throughput technologies have uncovered a wealth of transcript diversity generated by alternative splicing, as well as examples for how this diversity can be established and become misregulated. A variety of mechanisms modulate splice site choice coordinately with other cellular processes, from transcription and mRNA editing or decay to miRNA-based regulation and telomerase function.

The traits of locust phases are discussed and it is concluded that there are distinct strain-dependent differences in phase characteristics and their amplitudes even in the same species. Despite some advances, no major break-through was achieved in the putative endocrine control of locust phase polymorphism. Phase-dependent differences in adipokinesis, flight fuels and migration of adult locusts, as well as novel methods in studying aggregation behaviour and activity of hoppers and adults, opened new lines in research of the physiology of locust phase polymorphism. Marked advances were made in phase-related locust pheromone research, revealing, in Schistocerca gregaria, differences between the pheromonal system of the hoppers and that of the adults. These systems turned out to be more complex than previously assumed. Phenylacetonitrile, produced by sexually mature adult males, serving both as an attractant and a mutration-accelerating factor, was identified as the major compound of the adult pheromonal system in S. gregaria. A new aspect of transmission of phase characteristics from parent to progeny through the foam (froth) of the egg pod was revealed. Effects of some plant substances on locust phases were reported. However, no research has yet been published on the aspects of molecular biology of locust phase polymorphism.},

The effect occurred in hepatoma and HeLa cells with siRNA antisense strands designed to enter the silencing pathway, suggesting hybridization with nascent pre-mRNA. Unexpectedly, in HeLa cells the sense strands were also effective, suggesting that an endogenous antisense transcript, detectable in HeLa but not in hepatoma cells, acts as a target. The effect depends on Argonaute-1 and is counterbalanced by factors favoring chromatin opening or transcriptional elongation. The increase in heterochromatin marks (dimethylation at Lys9 and trimethylation at Lys27 of histone H3) at the target site, the need for the heterochromatin-associated protein HP1alpha and the reduction in RNA polymerase II processivity suggest a mechanism involving the kinetic coupling of transcription and alternative splicing.},

abstract = {Down syndrome (DS), a major cause of mental retardation, is characterized by subtle abnormalities of cortical neuroanatomy, neurochemistry and function. Recent work has shown that chromosome band 21q22 is critical for many of the neurological phenotypes of DS. A gene, DSCAM (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule), has now been isolated from chromosome band 21q22.2-22.3. Homology searches indicate that the putative DSCAM protein is a novel member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that represents a new class of neural cell adhesion molecules. The sequence of cDNAs indicates alternative splicing and predicts two protein isoforms, both containing 10 Ig-C2 domains, with nine at the N-terminus and the tenth located between domains 4 and 5 of the following array of six fibronectin III domains, with or without the following transmembrane and intracellular domains. Northern analyses reveals the transcripts of 9.7, 8.5 and 7.6 kb primarily in brain. These transcripts are differentially expressed in substructures of the adult brain. Tissue in situ hybridization analyses of a mouse homolog of the DSCAM gene revealed broad expression within the nervous system at the time of neuronal differentiation in the neural tube, cortex, hippocampus, medulla, spinal cord and most neural crest-derived tissues. Given its location on chromosome 21, its specific expression in the central nervous system and neural crest, and the homologies to molecules involved in neural migration, differentiation, and synaptic function, we propose that DSCAM is involved in neural differentiation and contributes to the central and peripheral nervous system defects in DS.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is critical for diversifying eukaryotic proteomes, but the rules governing and coordinating splicing events among multiple alternate splice sites within individual genes are not well understood. We developed a quantitative PCR-based strategy to quantify the expression of the 12 transcripts encoded by the Caenorhabditis elegans slo-1 gene, containing three alternate splice sites. Using conditional probability-based models, we show that splicing events are coordinated across these sites. Further, we identify a point mutation in an intron adjacent to one alternate splice site that disrupts alternative splicing at all three sites. This mutation leads to aberrant synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction. In a genomic survey, we found that a UAAAUC element disrupted by this mutation is enriched in introns flanking alternate exons in genes with multiple alternate splice sites. These results establish that proper coordination of intragenic alternative splicing is essential for normal physiology of slo-1 in vivo and identify putative specialized cis-regulatory elements that regulate the coordination of intragenic alternative splicing.},

@article{ENCODE2009,
abstract = {The transcriptomes of eukaryotic cells are incredibly complex. Individual non-coding RNAs dwarf the number of protein-coding genes, and include classes that are well understood as well as classes for which the nature, extent and functional roles are obscure. Deep sequencing of small RNAs (<200 nucleotides) from human HeLa and HepG2 cells revealed a remarkable breadth of species. These arose both from within annotated genes and from unannotated intergenic regions. Overall, small RNAs tended to align with CAGE (cap-analysis of gene expression) tags, which mark the 5' ends of capped, long RNA transcripts. Many small RNAs, including the previously described promoter-associated small RNAs, appeared to possess cap structures. Members of an extensive class of both small RNAs and CAGE tags were distributed across internal exons of annotated protein coding and non-coding genes, sometimes crossing exon-exon junctions. Here we show that processing of mature mRNAs through an as yet unknown mechanism may generate complex populations of both long and short RNAs whose apparently capped 5' ends coincide. Supplying synthetic promoter-associated small RNAs corresponding to the c-MYC transcriptional start site reduced MYC messenger RNA abundance. The studies presented here expand the catalogue of cellular small RNAs and demonstrate a biological impact for at least one class of non-canonical small RNAs.},

Here, we show that Dscam expression levels serve as an instructive code for the size control of presynaptic arbor. Two convergent pathways, involving dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), control Dscam expression through protein translation. Defects in this regulation of Dscam translation lead to exuberant presynaptic arbor growth in Drosophila somatosensory neurons.

abstract = {RNA can hybridize to double-stranded DNA in the presence of 70\% formamide by displacing the identical DNA strand. The resulting structure, called an R-loop, is formed in formamide probably because of the greater thermodynamic stability of the RNA-DNA hybrid when it is near the denaturation temperature of duplex DNA. The rate of R-loop formation is maximal at the temperature at which half of the duplex DNA is irreversibly converted to single-stranded DNA (the strand separation temperature of tss) of the duplex DNA and falls precipitously a few degrees above or below that temperature. This maximal rate is similar to the rate of hybridization of RNA to single-stranded DNA under the same conditions. At temperatures above the tss the rate is proportional to the RNA concentration. However, at temperatures below tss the rate of R-loop formation is less dependent upon the RNA concentration. Once formed, the R-loops display considerable stability; the formamide can be removed and the DNA can be cleaved with restriction endonucleases without loss of R-loop structures.},

abstract = {The control of RNA synthesis from protein-coding genes is fundamental in determining the various cell types of higher eukaryotes. The activation of these genes is driven by promoter complexes, and RNA synthesis is performed by an enzyme mega-complex—the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. These two complexes are the fundamental components required to initiate gene expression and generate the primary transcripts that, after processing, yield mRNAs that pass to the cytoplasm where protein synthesis occurs. But although this gene expression pathway has been studied intensively, aspects of RNA metabolism remain difficult to comprehend. In particular, it is unclear why >95\% of RNA polymerized by polymerase II remains in the nucleus, where it is recycled. To explain this apparent paradox, this review presents a detailed description of nuclear RNA (nRNA) metabolism in mammalian cells. We evaluate the number of active transcription units, discuss the distribution of polymerases on active genes, and assess the efficiency with which the products mature and pass to the cytoplasm. Differences between the behavior of mRNAs on this productive pathway and primary transcripts that never leave the nucleus lead us to propose that these represent distinct populations. We discuss possible roles for nonproductive RNAs and present a model to describe the metabolism of these RNAs in the nuclei of mammalian cells.—Jackson, D. A., Pombo, A., Iborra, F.

We demonstrate that, by adopting a gene-loop conformation, actively transcribed mRNA encoding genes restrict divergent transcription of ncRNAs. Because gene-loop formation depends on a protein factor (Ssu72) that coassociates with both the promoter and the terminator, the inactivation of Ssu72 leads to increased synthesis of promoter-associated divergent ncRNAs, referred to as Ssu72-restricted transcripts (SRTs). Similarly, inactivation of individual gene loops by gene mutation enhances SRT synthesis. We demonstrate that gene-loop conformation enforces transcriptional directionality on otherwise bidirectional promoters.},

abstract = {Recent analyses of sequence and microarray data have suggested that alternative splicing plays a major role in the generation of proteomic and functional diversity in metazoan organisms. Efforts are now being directed at establishing the full repertoire of functionally relevant transcript variants generated by alternative splicing, the specific roles of such variants in normal and disease physiology, and how alternative splicing is coordinated on a global level to achieve cell- and tissue-specific functions. Recent progress in these areas is summarized in this review.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regions covering one percent of the genome, selected by ENCODE for extensive analysis, were annotated by the HAVANA/Gencode group with high quality transcripts, thus defining a benchmark. The ENCODE Genome Annotation Assessment Project (EGASP) competition aimed at reproducing Gencode and finding new genes. The organizers evaluated the protein predictions in depth. We present a complementary analysis of the mRNAs, including alternative transcript variants.

RESULTS: We evaluate 25 gene tracks from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser. We either distinguish or collapse the alternative splice variants, and compare the genomic coordinates of exons, introns and nucleotides. Whole mRNA models, seen as chains of introns, are sorted to find the best matching pairs, and compared so that each mRNA is used only once. At the mRNA level, AceView is by far the closest to Gencode: the vast majority of transcripts of the two methods, including alternative variants, are identical. At the protein level, however, due to a lack of experimental data, our predictions differ: Gencode annotates proteins in only 41\% of the mRNAs whereas AceView does so in virtually all. We describe the driving principles of AceView, and how, by performing hand-supervised automatic annotation, we solve the combinatorial splicing problem and summarize all of GenBank, dbEST and RefSeq into a genome-wide non-redundant but comprehensive cDNA-supported transcriptome. AceView accuracy is now validated by Gencode.

CONCLUSION: Relative to a consensus mRNA catalog constructed from all evidence-based annotations, Gencode and AceView have 81\% and 84\% sensitivity, and 74\% and 73\% specificity, respectively. This close agreement validates a richer view of the human transcriptome, with three to five times more transcripts than in UCSC Known Genes (sensitivity 28\%), RefSeq (sensitivity 21\%) or Ensembl (sensitivity 19\%).},

As the miRNA field is still in its relative infancy, there is currently a lack of consensus regarding optimal methodologies for miRNA quantification, data analysis and data standardization. To investigate miRNA measurement we selected a panel of both synthetic miRNA spikes and endogenous miRNAs to evaluate assay performance, copy number estimation, and relative quantification. We compared two different miRNA quantification methodologies and also assessed the impact of short RNA enrichment on the miRNA measurement. We found that both short RNA enrichment and quantification strategy used had a significant impact on miRNA measurement. Our findings illustrate that miRNA quantification can be influenced by the choice of methodology and this must be considered when interpreting miRNA analyses. Furthermore, we show that synthetic miRNA spikes can be used as effective experimental controls for the short RNA enrichment procedure.},

abstract = {RNA targets of multitargeted RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can be studied by various methods including mobility shift assays, iterative in vitro selection techniques and computational approaches. These techniques, however, cannot be used to identify the cellular context within which mRNAs associate, nor can they be used to elucidate the dynamic composition of RNAs in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes in response to physiological stimuli. But by combining biochemical and genomics procedures to isolate and identify RNAs associated with RNA-binding proteins, information regarding RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions can be examined more directly within a cellular context. Several protocols--including the yeast three-hybrid system and immunoprecipitations that use physical or chemical cross-linking--have been developed to address this issue. Cross-linking procedures in general, however, are limited by inefficiency and sequence biases. The approach outlined here, termed RNP immunoprecipitation-microarray (RIP-Chip), allows the identification of discrete subsets of RNAs associated with multi-targeted RNA-binding proteins and provides information regarding changes in the intracellular composition of mRNPs in response to physical, chemical or developmental inducements of living systems. Thus, RIP-Chip can be used to identify subsets of RNAs that have related functions and are potentially co-regulated, as well as proteins that are associated with them in RNP complexes. Using RIP-Chip, the identification and/or quantification of RNAs in RNP complexes can be accomplished within a few hours or days depending on the RNA detection method used.},

abstract = {Almost all polymerase II transcripts undergo alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Here, we review the functions of alternative splicing events that have been experimentally determined. The overall function of alternative splicing is to increase the diversity of mRNAs expressed from the genome. Alternative splicing changes proteins encoded by mRNAs, which has profound functional effects. Experimental analysis of these protein isoforms showed that alternative splicing regulates binding between proteins, between proteins and nucleic acids as well as between proteins and membranes. Alternative splicing regulates the localization of proteins, their enzymatic properties and their interaction with ligands. In most cases, changes caused by individual splicing isoforms are small. However, cells typically coordinate numerous changes in ‘splicing programs’, which can have strong effects on cell proliferation, cell survival and properties of the nervous system. Due to its widespread usage and molecular versatility, alternative splicing emerges as a central element in gene regulation that interferes with almost every biological function analyzed.},

abstract = {Correlation of motif occurrences with gene expression intensity is an effective strategy for elucidating transcriptional cis-regulatory logic. Here we demonstrate that this approach can also identify cis-regulatory elements for alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Using data from a human exon microarray, we identified 56 cassette exons that exhibited higher transcript-normalized expression in muscle than in other normal adult tissues. Intron sequences flanking these exons were then analyzed to identify candidate regulatory motifs for muscle-specific alternative splicing. Correlation of motif parameters with gene-normalized exon expression levels was examined using linear regression and linear splines on RNA words and degenerate weight matrices, respectively. Our unbiased analysis uncovered multiple candidate regulatory motifs for muscle-specific splicing, many of which are phylogenetically conserved among vertebrate genomes. The most prominent downstream motifs were binding sites for Fox1- and CELF-related splicing factors, and a branchpoint-like element acuaac; pyrimidine-rich elements resembling PTB-binding sites were most significant in upstream introns. Intriguingly, our systematic study indicates a paucity of novel muscle-specific elements that are dominant in short proximal intronic regions. We propose that Fox and CELF proteins play major roles in enforcing the muscle-specific alternative splicing program, facilitating expression of unique isoforms of cytoskeletal proteins critical to muscle cell function.},

@article{DeConti2013,
abstract = {One of the fundamental issues in RNA splicing research is represented by understanding how the spliceosome can successfully define exons and introns in a huge variety of pre-mRNA molecules with nucleotide-precision. Since its first description, researchers in this field have identified and characterized many fundamental elements and players capable of affecting the splicing process, both in a negative and positive manner. Indeed, it can be argued that today we know a great deal about the forces that make an exon, an exon and an intron, an intron. As will be discussed in this review, these decisions are a result of a complex combinatorial control resulting from many different factors/influences. Most importantly, these influences act across several levels of complexity starting from the relatively simple interaction between two consensus 5' and 3' splice sites to much more complex factors: such as the interplay between silencer or enhancer sequences, transcriptional processivity, genomic milieu, nucleosome positioning, and histone modifications at the chromatin level. Depending on local contexts, all these factors will act either antagonistically or synergistically to decide the exon/intron fate of any given RNA sequence. At present, however, what we still lack is a precise understanding of how all these processes add up to help the spliceosome reach a decision. Therefore, it is expected that future challenges in splicing research will be the careful characterization of all these influences to improve our ability to predict splicing choices in different organisms or in specific contexts.},

Moreover, the bidirectional activity of a promoter is regulated at multiple points during transcription, giving rise to diverse types of transcripts.},

We developed a novel index-based computational method (CovaRNA) to detect long-range covariation on a genomic scale, as well as another computational method (CovStat) for determining the statistical significance of observed covariation patterns in alignment pairs. Here we present an all-versus-all search for nucleotide covariation in Drosophila genomic alignments. The search is genome wide, with the restriction that only alignments that correspond to euchromatic regions, which consist of at least 10 Drosophila species, are being considered (59\% of the euchromatic genome of Drosophila melanogaster). We find that long-range covariations are especially prevalent between exons of mRNAs as well as noncoding RNAs; the majority of the observed covariations appear as not reverse complementary, but as synchronized mutations, which could be due to interactions with common interaction partners or due to the involvement of genomic elements that are antisense of annotated transcripts. The involved genes are enriched for functions related to regionalization as well as neural and developmental processes. These results are computational evidence that RNA-RNA long-range interactions are a widespread phenomenon that is of fundamental importance to a variety of cellular processes.},

abstract = {A recent slew of ENCODE Consortium publications, specifically the article signed by all Consortium members, put forward the idea that more than 80\% of the human genome is functional. This claim flies in the face of current estimates according to which the fraction of the genome that is evolutionarily conserved through purifying selection is under 10\%. Thus, according to the ENCODE Consortium, a biological function can be maintained indefinitely without selection, which implies that at least 80 - 10 = 70\% of the genome is perfectly invulnerable to deleterious mutations, either because no mutation can ever occur in these "functional" regions, or because no mutation in these regions can ever be deleterious. This absurd conclusion was reached through various means, chiefly (1) by employing the seldom used "causal role" definition of biological function and then applying it inconsistently to different biochemical properties, (2) by committing a logical fallacy known as "affirming the consequent," (3) by failing to appreciate the crucial difference between "junk DNA" and "garbage DNA," (4) by using analytical methods that yield biased errors and inflate estimates of functionality, (5) by favoring statistical sensitivity over specificity, and (6) by emphasizing statistical significance rather than the magnitude of the effect. Here, we detail the many logical and methodological transgressions involved in assigning functionality to almost every nucleotide in the human genome. The ENCODE results were predicted by one of its authors to necessitate the rewriting of textbooks.

abstract = {Piwi-interacting (pi) RNAs are germline-expressed small RNAs linked to epigenetic programming. C. elegans piRNAs are thought to be transcribed as independent gene-like loci. To test this idea and to identify potential transcription start (TS) sites for piRNA precursors, we developed CapSeq, an efficient enzymatic method for 5' anchored RNA profiling. Using CapSeq, we identify candidate TS sites, defined by 70-90 nt sequence tags, for >50\% of annotated Pol II loci. Surprisingly, however, these CapSeq tags failed to identify the overwhelming majority of piRNA loci. Instead, we show that the likely piRNA precursors are ∼26 nt capped small (cs) RNAs that initiate precisely 2 nt upstream of mature piRNAs and that piRNA processing or stability requires a U at the csRNA +3 position. Finally, we identify a heretofore unrecognized class of piRNAs processed from csRNAs that are expressed at promoters genome wide, nearly doubling the number of piRNAs available for genome surveillance.},

abstract = {Single-molecule sequencing instruments can generate multikilobase sequences with the potential to greatly improve genome and transcriptome assembly. However, the error rates of single-molecule reads are high, which has limited their use thus far to resequencing bacteria. To address this limitation, we introduce a correction algorithm and assembly strategy that uses short, high-fidelity sequences to correct the error in single-molecule sequences. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on reads generated by a PacBio RS instrument from phage, prokaryotic and eukaryotic whole genomes, including the previously unsequenced genome of the parrot Melopsittacus undulatus, as well as for RNA-Seq reads of the corn (Zea mays) transcriptome. Our long-read correction achieves >99.9\% base-call accuracy, leading to substantially better assemblies than current sequencing strategies: in the best example, the median contig size was quintupled relative to high-coverage, second-generation assemblies. Greater gains are predicted if read lengths continue to increase, including the prospect of single-contig bacterial chromosome assembly.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in a number of human disorders. However, the discovery of compounds that target the splicing reaction has been hindered by the lack of suitable high-throughput screening assays. Conversely, the effects of known drugs on the splicing reaction are mostly unclear and not routinely assessed. We have developed a two-color fluorescent reporter for cellular assays of exon inclusion that can accommodate nearly any cassette exon and minimizes interfering effects from changes in transcription and translation. We used microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) exon 10, whose missplicing causes frontotemporal dementia, to test the reporter in screening libraries of known bioactive compounds. These screens yielded several compounds that alter the splicing of the exon, both in the reporter and in the endogenous MAPT mRNA. One compound, digoxin, has long been used in the treatment of heart failure, but was not known to modulate splicing. The positive compounds target different signal transduction pathways, and microarray analysis shows that each compound affects the splicing of a different set of exons in addition to MAPT exon 10. Our results identify currently prescribed cardiotonic steroids as modulators of alternative splicing and demonstrate the feasibility of screening for drugs that alter exon inclusion.},

Using recombinant inbred strains as a CO library, here we report the identification and detailed characterization of seven new meiotic hot spots on mouse chromosome 19, more than doubling the number of currently available mouse hot spots. Although a shared feature is the narrow 1.5–2.5-kb width of these recombinogenic sites, these analyses revealed that hot spots have diverse sequence attributes and distinct symmetric and asymmetric CO profiles. Interestingly, CO molecules with discontinuous conversion tracts are commonly observed, contrasting with those found in human. Furthermore, unlike human hot spots, those present in the mouse do not necessarily have a quasi-normal CO distribution but harbor CO repulsion zones within recombinogenic cores. We propose a model where local chromatin landscape directs these repulsion zones.},

We analyzed the Dscam mRNA isoforms expressed by different cell types and individual cells. The choice of splice variants expressed is regulated both spatially and temporally. Different subtypes of photoreceptors express broad yet distinctive spectra of Dscam isoforms. Single-cell RT-PCR documented that individual cells express several different Dscam isoforms and allowed an estimation of the diversity that is present. For example, we estimate that each R3/R4 photoreceptor cell expresses 14-50 distinct mRNAs chosen from the spectrum of thousands of splice variants distinctive of its cell type. Thus, the Dscam repertoire of each cell is different from those of its neighbors, providing a potential mechanism for generating unique cell identity in the nervous system and elsewhere.},

In Drosophila, transposon-rich heterochromatic clusters encode piRNAs either on both genomic strands (dual-strand clusters) or predominantly one genomic strand (uni-strand clusters). Primary piRNAs derived from these clusters are proposed to drive a ping-pong amplification cycle catalyzed by proteins that localize to the perinuclear nuage. We show that the HP1 homolog Rhino is required for nuage organization, transposon silencing, and ping-pong amplification of piRNAs. rhi mutations virtually eliminate piRNAs from the dual-strand clusters and block production of putative precursor RNAs from both strands of the major 42AB dual-strand cluster, but not of transcripts or piRNAs from the uni-strand clusters. Furthermore, Rhino protein associates with the 42AB dual-strand cluster,but does not bind to uni-strand cluster 2 or flamenco. Rhino thus appears to promote transcription of dual-strand clusters, leading to production of piRNAs that drive the ping-pong amplification cycle.</p>},

abstract = {Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs that direct repression of their mRNA targets. The miRNA “seed”—nucleotides 2–7—establishes target specificity by mediating target binding [1–5]. Accurate processing of the miRNA 5′ end is thought to be under strong selective pressure [6, 7] because a shift by just one nucleotide in the 5′ end of a miRNA alters its seed sequence, redefining its repertoire of targets (Figure 1). Animal miRNAs are produced by the sequential cleavage of partially double-stranded precursors by the RNase III endonucleases Drosha and Dicer, thereby generating a transitory double-stranded intermediate comprising the miRNA paired to its partially complementary miRNA∗ strand [8, 9]. Here, we report that in flies, the 5′ ends of miRNAs and miRNA∗ strands are typically more precisely defined than their 3′ ends. Surprisingly, the precision of the 5′ ends of both miRNA and miRNA∗ sequences increases after Argonaute2 (Ago2) loading. Our data imply that either many miRNA∗ sequences are under evolutionary pressure to maintain their seed sequences—that is, they have targets—or that secondary constraints, such as the sequence requirements for loading small RNAs into functional Argonaute complexes, narrow the range of miRNA and miRNA∗ 5′ ends that accumulate in flies.},

abstract = {The human CD45 gene encodes five isoforms of a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase that differ in their extracellular domains as a result of alternative splicing of exons 4-6. Expression of the CD45 isoforms is tightly regulated in peripheral T cells such that resting cells predominantly express the larger CD45 isoforms, encoded by mRNAs containing two or three variable exons. In contrast, activated T cells express CD45 isoforms encoded by mRNAs lacking most or all of the variable exons. We have previously identified the sequences within CD45 variable exon 4 that control its level of inclusion into spliced mRNAs. Here we map the splicingregulatory sequences within CD45 variable exons 5 and 6. We show that, like exon 4, exons 5 and 6 each contain an exonic splicing silencer (ESS) and an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), which together determine the level of exon inclusion in na\"{\i}ve cells. We further demonstrate that the primary activation-responsive silencing motif in exons 5 and 6 is homologous to that in exon 4 and, as in exon 4, binds specifically to the protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L. Together these studies reveal common themes in the regulation of the CD45 variable exons and provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed physiological expression of CD45 isoforms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human genes undergo various patterns of pre-mRNA splicing across different tissues. Such variation is primarily regulated by trans-acting factors that bind on exonic and intronic cis-acting RNA elements (CAEs). Here we report a computational method to mechanistically identify cis-acting RNA elements that contribute to the tissue-specific alternative splicing pattern. This method is an extension of our previous model, SplicingModeler, which predicts the significant CAEs that contribute to the splicing differences between two tissues. In this study, we introduce tissue-specific functional levels estimation step, which allows evaluating regulatory functions of predicted CAEs that are involved in more than two tissues. RESULTS: Using a publicly available Affymetrix Genechip Human Exon Array dataset, our method identifies 652 cis-acting RNA elements (CAEs) across 11 human tissues. About one third of predicted CAEs can be mapped to the known RBP (RNA binding protein) binding sites or match with other predicted exonic splicing regulator databases. Interestingly, the vast majority of predicted CAEs are in intronic regulatory regions. A noticeable exception is that many exonic elements are found to regulate the alternative splicing between cerebellum and testes. Most identified elements are found to contribute to the alternative splicing between two tissues, while some are important in multiple tissues. This suggests that genome-wide alternative splicing patterns are regulated by a combination of tissue-specific cis-acting elements and "general elements" whose functional activities are important but differ across multiple tissues. CONCLUSION: In this study, we present a model-based computational approach to identify potential cis-acting RNA elements by considering the exon splicing variation as the combinatorial effects of multiple cis-acting regulators. This methodology provides a novel evaluation on the functional levels of cis-acting RNA elements by estimating their tissue-specific functions on various tissues.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is tightly regulated in a spatio-temporal and quantitative manner. This regulation is achieved by a complex interplay between spliceosomal (trans) factors that bind to different sequence (cis) elements. cis-elements reside in both introns and exons and may either enhance or silence splicing. Differential combinations of cis-elements allows for a huge diversity of overall splicing signals, together comprising a complex 'splicing code'. Many cis-elements have been identified, and their effects on exon inclusion levels demonstrated in reporter systems. However, the impact of interspecific differences in these elements on the evolution of alternative splicing levels has not yet been investigated at genomic level. Here we study the effect of interspecific differences in predicted exonic splicing regulators (ESRs) on exon inclusion levels in human and chimpanzee. For this purpose, we compiled and studied comprehensive datasets of predicted ESRs, identified by several computational and experimental approaches, as well as microarray data for changes in alternative splicing levels between human and chimpanzee. Surprisingly, we found no association between changes in predicted ESRs and changes in alternative splicing levels. This observation holds across different ESR exon positions, exon lengths, and 5' splice site strengths. We suggest that this lack of association is mainly due to the great importance of context for ESR functionality: many ESR-like motifs in primates may have little or no effect on splicing, and thus interspecific changes at short-time scales may primarily occur in these effectively neutral ESRs. These results underscore the difficulties of using current computational ESR prediction algorithms to identify truly functionally important motifs, and provide a cautionary tale for studies of the effect of SNPs on splicing in human disease.},

abstract = {Using an unsupervised pattern-discovery method, we processed the human intergenic and intronic regions and catalogued all variable-length patterns with identically conserved copies and multiplicities above what is expected by chance. Among the millions of discovered patterns, we found a subset of 127,998 patterns, termed pyknons, which have additional nonoverlapping instances in the untranslated and protein-coding regions of 30,675 transcripts from 20,059 human genes. The pyknons arrange combinatorially in the untranslated and coding regions of numerous human genes where they form mosaics. Consecutive instances of pyknons in these regions show a strong bias in their relative placement, favoring distances of ≈22 nucleotides. We also found pyknons to be enriched in a statistically significant manner in genes involved in specific processes, e.g., cell communication, transcription, regulation of transcription, signaling, transport, etc. For ≈1/3 of the pyknons, the intergenic/intronic instances of their reverse complement lie within 380,084 nonoverlapping regions, typically 60–80 nucleotides long, which are predicted to form double-stranded, energetically stable, hairpin-shaped RNA secondary structures; additionally, the pyknons subsume ≈40\% of the known microRNA sequences, thus suggesting a possible link with posttranscriptional gene silencing and RNA interference. Cross-genome comparisons reveal that many of the pyknons have instances in the 3′ UTRs of genes from other vertebrates and invertebrates where they are overrepresented in similar biological processes, as in the human genome. These unexpected findings suggest potential unique functional connections between the coding and noncoding parts of the human genome.

Zucchini (Zuc), the Drosophila homolog of MITOPLD, has been implicated in primary biogenesis of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). By contrast, MITOPLD has been shown to hydrolyze cardiolipin in the outer membrane of mitochondria to generate phosphatidic acid, which is a signaling molecule. To assess whether the mammalian MITOPLD is involved in piRNA biogenesis, we generated Mitopld mutant mice. The mice display meiotic arrest during spermatogenesis, demethylation and derepression of retrotransposons, and defects in primary piRNA biogenesis. Furthermore, in mutant germ cells, mitochondria and the components of the nuage, a perinuclear structure involved in piRNA biogenesis/function, are mislocalized to regions around the centrosome, suggesting that MITOPLD may be involved in microtubule-dependent localization of mitochondria and these proteins. Our results indicate a conserved role for MITOPLD/Zuc in the piRNA pathway and link mitochondrial membrane metabolism/signaling to small RNA biogenesis.</p>},

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a common tool for measuring relative gene expression levels. However, as an absolute quantitative tool, the data are prone to various distortions due to biases from library preparation. We improve the quantitative aspects of RNA-Seq by barcoding individual cDNA molecules to correct for amplification bias, distinguish clonal replicates, and obtain absolute measurements of gene expression. We have also developed a set of barcoded synthetic RNAs that can be spiked into samples as easy-to-use quantitative controls. Additionally, we demonstrate the combined use of capture enrichment with molecular barcoding for the sequencing of targeted genes. These results demonstrate low library preparation efficiency leading to the stochastic loss of low-abundance transcripts, which cannot be overcome by simply increasing sequencing depth.

Introduction:

        
>As a profiling tool, the method is primarily challenged by the large dynamic range of expression levels of mRNAs in a library. Sequencing of millions to tens of millions of copies of high-abundance transcripts is required to detect rare transcripts of interest (3, 4).

        

        
> Reports estimate that ∼40 million reads may be required for the reliable measurement of gene expression for transcripts of high and moderate abundance, and as many as 500 million reads may be required to cover the full sequence diversity of a complex transcript library (1, 5, 6). 

        
Results: 

        
> Each cDNA molecule is labeled at random from a reservoir of ∼10,000 distinct molecular-indexing barcode combinations. 

        

        
> We have found this method to be sufficient for most RNA-Seq measurements, because exceeding 9,216 copies of identical cDNA fragments for any given mRNA transcript is highly unlikely. Paired-end reads reveal the molecular index combination along with the adjoining cDNA fragment sequence of an mRNA transcript (Fig. 1B).

        
Discussion:

        
> The incorporation of molecular indexing also allows us to ascertain the absolute numbers of transcripts present in a library. 

        
>Quantitative experiments reveal that only a small portion of the initial RNA successfully converts to sequencing-ready cDNA templates. 

        
**And my favorite!**

        
>It is useful to consider the implications of low library efficiency in the context of a typical RNA-Seq experiment. Although in early experiments, it was routine to use 1 µg or more of total RNA as the input sample (1), more recent emphasis on cellular specificity has driven many investigators to use 50 ng or less total RNA. Based on the average value of 10 pg of RNA per cell, this value represents ∼5,000 cell equivalents. Assuming ∼200,000 mRNAs in a single cell, we can expect ∼1 × 1\^{}9 mRNA molecules in the sample. At an overall efficiency of ∼0.1\%, the resulting library will be on the order of 1 × 1\^{}6 molecules (ignoring RNA fragmentation for simplicity). Based on Poisson sampling, a library of 1 × 1\^{}6 fragments quickly reaches saturation well before 2 × 1\^{}7 reads (20× sampling) (Fig. S3). **At this sequencing depth, effectively all unique molecules in the library have been sampled, and very little new information will be obtained by additional sequencing. Any transcripts that were present in the starting material at less than ∼1,000 copies are simply lost. This problem is further exacerbated with studies on alternative splicing, allelic variation, or rare isoforms or where the transcripts of interest are limited to a subset of the cells.**

abstract = {Summary 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) guide Argonaute proteins to silence mRNA expression. Argonaute binding alters the properties of an RNA guide, creating functional domains. We show that the domains established by Argonaute—the anchor, seed, central, 3′ supplementary, and tail regions—have distinct biochemical properties that explain the differences between how animal miRNAs and siRNAs bind their targets. Extensive complementarity between an siRNA and its target slows the rate at which fly Argonaute2 (Ago2) binds to and dissociates from the target. Highlighting its role in antiviral defense, fly Ago2 dissociates so slowly from extensively complementary target RNAs that essentially every fully paired target is cleaved. Conversely, mouse AGO2, which mainly mediates miRNA-directed repression, dissociates rapidly and with similar rates for fully paired and seed-matched targets. Our data narrow the range of biochemically reasonable models for how Argonaute-bound siRNAs and miRNAs find, bind, and regulate their targets.},

abstract = {Mammalian germ cells undergo global reprogramming of DNA methylation during their development. Global DNA demethylation occurs around the time when the primordial germ cells colonize the embryonic gonads and this coincides with dynamic changes in chromatin composition. Global de novo DNA methylation takes place with remarkably different dynamics between the two sexes, prospermatogonia attaining methylation during fetal stages and oocytes attaining methylation postnatally. Our hypothesis was that dynamic changes in chromatin composition may precede or accompany the wave of global DNA de novo methylation as well. We used immunocytochemistry to measure global DNA methylation and chromatin components in male and female mouse fetal germ cells compared to control somatic cells of the gonad. We found that global DNA methylation levels sharply increased in male germ cells at 17.5 days post coitum, but remained low in female germ cells at all fetal stages. Global changes in chromatin composition: i, preceded global DNA methylation in fetal germ cells; ii, sex specifically occurred in male but not in female germ cells; iii, affected active and repressive histone marks and iv, included histone tail and histone globular domain modifications. Our data suggest that dynamic changes of chromatin composition may provide a framework for the pattern of male-specific de novo DNA methylation in prospermatogonia.},

Multiple lines of evidence increasingly link mutations and dysregulations of lncRNAs to diverse human diseases. Alterations in the primary structure, secondary structure, and expression levels of lncRNAs as well as their cognate RNA-binding proteins underlie diseases ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer. Recent progress suggests that the involvement of lncRNAs in human diseases could be far more prevalent than previously appreciated. We review the evidence linking lncRNAs to diverse human diseases and highlight fundamental concepts in lncRNA biology that still need to be clarified to provide a robust framework for lncRNA genetics.</p>},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Discovery that the transcriptional output of the human genome is far more complex than predicted by the current set of protein-coding annotations and that most RNAs produced do not appear to encode proteins has transformed our understanding of genome complexity and suggests new paradigms of genome regulation. However, the fraction of all cellular RNA whose function we do not understand and the fraction of the genome that is utilized to produce that RNA remain controversial. This is not simply a bookkeeping issue because the degree to which this un-annotated transcription is present has important implications with respect to its biologic function and to the general architecture of genome regulation. For example, efforts to elucidate how non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) regulate genome function will be compromised if that class of RNAs is dismissed as simply 'transcriptional noise'.RESULTS:We show that the relative mass of RNA whose function and/or structure we do not understand (the so called 'dark matter' RNAs), as a proportion of all non-ribosomal, non-mitochondrial human RNA (mt-RNA), can be greater than that of protein-encoding transcripts. This observation is obscured in studies that focus only on polyA-selected RNA, a method that enriches for protein coding RNAs and at the same time discards the vast majority of RNA prior to analysis. We further show the presence of a large number of very long, abundantly-transcribed regions (100's of kb) in intergenic space and further show that expression of these regions is associated with neoplastic transformation. These overlap some regions found previously in normal human embryonic tissues and raises an interesting hypothesis as to the function of these ncRNAs in both early development and neoplastic transformation.CONCLUSIONS:We conclude that 'dark matter' RNA can constitute the majority of non-ribosomal, non-mitochondrial-RNA and a significant fraction arises from numerous very long, intergenic transcribed regions that could be involved in neoplastic transformation.},

@article{Geisler2012,
abstract = {Summary
Decapping represents a critical control point in regulating expression of protein coding genes. Here, we demonstrate that decapping also modulates expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Specifically, levels of \&gt;100 lncRNAs in yeast are controlled by decapping and are degraded by a pathway that occurs independent of decapping regulators. We find many lncRNAs degraded by DCP2 are expressed proximal to inducible genes. Of these, we show several genes required for galactose utilization are associated with lncRNAs that have expression patterns inversely correlated with their mRNA counterpart. Moreover, decapping of these lncRNAs is critical for rapid and robust induction of GAL gene expression. Failure to destabilize a lncRNA known to exert repressive histone modifications results in perpetuation of a repressive chromatin state that contributes to reduced plasticity of gene activation. We propose that decapping and lncRNA degradation serve a vital role in transcriptional regulation specifically at inducible genes.},

@article{Zamparini2011,
abstract = {In Drosophila, Piwi proteins associate with Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and protect the germline genome by silencing mobile genetic elements. This defense system acts in germline and gonadal somatic tissue to preserve germline development. Genetic control for these silencing pathways varies greatly between tissues of the gonad. Here, we identified Vreteno (Vret), a novel gonad-specific protein essential for germline development. Vret is required for piRNA-based transposon regulation in both germline and somatic gonadal tissues. We show that Vret, which contains Tudor domains, associates physically with Piwi and Aubergine (Aub), stabilizing these proteins via a gonad-specific mechanism that is absent in other fly tissues. In the absence of vret, Piwi-bound piRNAs are lost without changes in piRNA precursor transcript production, supporting a role for Vret in primary piRNA biogenesis. In the germline, piRNAs can engage in an Aub- and Argonaute 3 (AGO3)-dependent amplification in the absence of Vret, suggesting that Vret function can distinguish between primary piRNAs loaded into Piwi-Aub complexes and piRNAs engaged in the amplification cycle. We propose that Vret plays an essential role in transposon regulation at an early stage of primary piRNA processing.},

abstract = {Through alternative processing of pre-messenger RNAs, individual mammalian genes often produce multiple mRNA and protein isoforms that may have related, distinct or even opposing functions. Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94\% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86\% with a minor isoform frequency of 15\% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

abstract = {Do data from the Encyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project render the notion of junk DNA obsolete? Here, I review older arguments for junk grounded in the C-value paradox and propose a thought experiment to challenge ENCODE’s ontology. Specifically, what would we expect for the number of functional elements (as ENCODE defines them) in genomes much larger than our own genome? If the number were to stay more or less constant, it would seem sensible to consider the rest of the DNA of larger genomes to be junk or, at least, assign it a different sort of role (structural rather than informational). If, however, the number of functional elements were to rise significantly with C-value then, (i) organisms with genomes larger than our genome are more complex phenotypically than we are, (ii) ENCODE’sdefinition of functional element identifies many sites that would not be considered functional or phenotype-determining by standard uses in biology, or (iii) the same phenotypic functions are often determined in a more diffuse fashion in larger-genomed organisms. Good cases can be made for propo- sitions ii and iii. A larger theoretical framework, embracing informational and structural roles for DNA, neutral aswell as adaptive causes of complexity, and selection as a multilevel phenomenon, is needed},

abstract = {The mammalian Phospholipase D MitoPLD facilitates mitochondrial fusion by generating the signaling lipid phosphatidic acid (PA). The Drosophila MitoPLD homolog Zucchini (Zuc), a proposed cytoplasmic nuclease, is required for piRNA generation, a critical event in germline development. We show that Zuc localizes to mitochondria and has MitoPLD-like activity. Conversely, MitoPLD(-/-) mice exhibit the meiotic arrest, DNA damage, and male sterility characteristic of mice lacking piRNAs. The primary function of MitoPLD seems to be the generation of mitochondrial-surface PA. This PA in turn recruits the phosphatase Lipin 1, which converts PA to diacylglycerol and promotes mitochondrial fission, suggesting a mechanism for mitochondrial morphology homeostasis. MitoPLD and Lipin 1 have opposing effects on mitochondria length and on intermitochondrial cement (nuage), a structure found between aggregated mitochondria that is implicated in piRNA generation. We propose that mitochondrial-surface PA generated by MitoPLD/Zuc recruits or activates nuage components critical for piRNA production.},

abstract = {The recent discovery that the human and other mammalian genomes produce thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) raises many fascinating questions. These mRNA-like molecules, which lack significant protein-coding capacity, have been implicated in a wide range of biological functions through diverse and as yet poorly understood molecular mechanisms. Despite some recent insights into how lncRNAs function in such diverse cellular processes as regulation of gene expression and assembly of cellular structures, by and large, the key questions regarding lncRNA mechanisms remain to be answered. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the biology of lncRNAs and propose avenues of investigation that may lead to fundamental new insights into their functions and mechanisms of action. Finally, as numerous lncRNAs are dysregulated in human diseases and disorders, we also discuss potential roles for these molecules in human health.},

In the past three years, several polynucleotide ligases have been crystallized in complex with nucleic acid, providing the introductory views of ligase enzymes engaging their substrates. Crystal structures for two ATP-dependent DNA ligases, an NAD+-dependent DNA ligase, and an ATP-dependent RNA ligase demonstrate how ligases utilize the AMP group and their multi-domain architectures to manipulate nucleic acid structure and catalyze the end-joining reaction.

Splicing is tightly regulated in different tissues and developmental stages, and its disruption can lead to a wide range of human diseases. An important long-term goal in the splicing field is to determine a set of rules or "code" for splicing that will enable prediction of the splicing pattern of any primary transcript from its sequence. Outside of the core splice site motifs, the bulk of the information required for splicing is thought to be contained in exonic and intronic cis-regulatory elements that function by recruitment of sequence-specific RNA-binding protein factors that either activate or repress the use of adjacent splice sites. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge of splicing cis-regulatory elements and their context-dependent effects on splicing, emphasizing recent global/genome-wide studies and open questions.},

abstract = {Transcription and pre-mRNA splicing are extremely complex multimolecular processes that involve protein-DNA, protein-RNA, and protein-protein interactions. Splicing occurs in the close vicinity of genes and is frequently cotranscriptional. This is consistent with evidence that both processes are coordinated and, in some cases, functionally coupled. This review focuses on the roles of cis- and trans-acting factors that regulate transcription, on constitutive and alternative splicing. We also discuss possible functions in splicing of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) largest subunit, whose participation in other key pre-mRNA processing reactions (capping and cleavage/polyadenylation) is well documented. Recent evidence indicates that transcriptional elongation and splicing can be influenced reciprocally: Elongation rates control alternative splicing and splicing factors can, in turn, modulate pol II elongation. The presence of transcription factors in the spliceosome and the existence of proteins, such as the coactivator PGC-1, with dual activities in splicing and transcription can explain the links between both processes and add a new level of complexity to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes.},

abstract = {The morphological, physiological and behavioural differences between solitarious and gregarious desert locusts are so pronounced that one could easily mistake the two phases as belonging to different species, if one has no knowledge of the phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity. A number of phase-specific features are hormonally controlled. Juvenile hormone promotes several solitarious features, the green cuticular colour being the most obvious one. The neuropeptide corazonin elicits the dark cuticular colour that is typical for the gregarious phase, as well as particular gregarious behavioural characteristics. However, it had to be concluded, for multiple reasons, that the endocrine system is not the primary phase-determining system. Our observation that longevity gets imprinted in very early life by crowding of the young hatchlings, and that it cannot be changed thereafter, made us consider the possibility that, perhaps, epigenetic control of gene expression might be, if not the missing, a primary phase-determining mechanism. Imprinting is likely to involve \{DNA\} methylation and histone modification. Analysis of a Schistocerca \{EST\} database of nervous tissue identified the presence of several candidate genes that may be involved in epigenetic control, including two \{DNA\} methyltransferases \{(Dnmts).\} Dnmt1 and Dnmt2 are phase-specifically expressed in certain tissues. In the metathoracic ganglion, important in the serotonin pathway for sensing mechanostimulation, their expression is clearly affected by crowding. Our data urge for reconsidering the role of the endocrine system as being sandwiched in between genetics and epigenetics, involving complementary modes of action.},

We have generated genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions in both resting and activated human CD4+ T cells by direct sequencing of nucleosome ends using the Solexa high-throughput sequencing technique. We find that nucleosome phasing relative to the transcription start sites is directly correlated to RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding. Furthermore, the first nucleosome downstream of a start site exhibits differential positioning in active and silent genes. TCR signaling induces extensive nucleosome reorganization in promoters and enhancers to allow transcriptional activation or repression. Our results suggest that H2A.Z-containing and modified nucleosomes are preferentially lost from the -1 nucleosome position. Our data provide a comprehensive view of the nucleosome landscape and its dynamic regulation in the human genome.},

abstract = {Almost all polymerase II transcripts undergo alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Here, we review the functions of alternative splicing events that have been experimentally determined. The overall function of alternative splicing is to increase the diversity of mRNAs expressed from the genome. Alternative splicing changes proteins encoded by mRNAs, which has profound functional effects. Experimental analysis of these protein isoforms showed that alternative splicing regulates binding between proteins, between proteins and nucleic acids as well as between proteins and membranes. Alternative splicing regulates the localization of proteins, their enzymatic properties and their interaction with ligands. In most cases, changes caused by individual splicing isoforms are small. However, cells typically coordinate numerous changes in 'splicing programs', which can have strong effects on cell proliferation, cell survival and properties of the nervous system. Due to its widespread usage and molecular versatility, alternative splicing emerges as a central element in gene regulation that interferes with almost every biological function analyzed.},

We applied chromosome conformation capture methods, 5C and Hi-C, across the cell cycle and revealed two alternative three-dimensional folding states of the human genome. We show that the highly compartmentalized and cell-type-specific organization described previously for non-synchronous cells is restricted to interphase. In metaphase, we identify a homogenous folding state, which is locus-independent, common to all chromosomes, and consistent among cell types, suggesting a general principle of metaphase chromosome organization. Using polymer simulations, we find that metaphase Hi-C data are inconsistent with classic hierarchical models, and is instead best described by a linearly-organized longitudinally compressed array of consecutive chromatin loops.},

Complex formation is promoted by the recognition of symmetrically dimethylated arginines at the N terminus of Mili by the tudor domains of Tdrd1. Similar to a Mili mutant, mice lacking Tdrd1 show derepression of L1 transposons accompanied by a loss of DNA methylation at their regulatory elements and delocalization of Miwi2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Finally, we show that Mili piRNPs devoid of Tdrd1 accept the entry of abundant cellular transcripts into the piRNA pathway and accumulate piRNAs with a profile that is drastically different from that of the wild type. Our data suggest that Tdrd1 ensures the entry of correct transcripts into the normal piRNA pool.},

abstract = {<p><br/>Over 40 different human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) mRNA species, both completely and incompletely spliced, are produced by alternative splicing of the primary viral RNA transcript. In addition, about half of the viral RNA remains unspliced and is transported to the cytoplasm where it is used both as mRNA and as genomic RNA. In general, the identities of the completely and incompletely spliced HIV-1 mRNA species are determined by the proximity of the open reading frames to the 5'-end of the mRNAs. The relative abundance of the mRNAs encoding the HIV-1 gene products is determined by the frequency of splicing at the different alternative 3'-splice sites. This chapter will highlight studies showing how HIV-1 uses exon definition to control the level of splicing at each of its 3'-splice sites through a combination of positively acting exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) elements, negatively acting exonic and intronic splicing silencer elements (ESS and ISS elements, respectively), and the 5'-splice sites of the regulated exons. Each of these splicing elements represent binding sites for cellular factors whose levels in the infected cell can determine the dominance of the positive or negative elements on HIV-1 alternative splicing. Both mutations of HIV-1 splicing elements and overexpression or inhibition of cellular splicing factors that bind to these elements have been used to show that disruption of regulated splicing inhibits HIV-1 replication. These studies have provided strong rationale for the investigation and development of antiviral drugs that specifically inhibit HIV-1 RNA splicing.</p>},

abstract = {The SF1 helicase MOV10 is an antiviral factor that is incorporated into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions. We now report that HIV-1 virions also incorporate UPF1, which belongs to the same SF1 helicase subfamily as MOV10 and functions in the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Unlike ectopic MOV10, the overexpression of UPF1 does not impair the infectivity of HIV-1 progeny virions. However, UPF1 becomes a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 progeny virion infectivity when residues required for its helicase activity are mutated. In contrast, equivalent mutations abolish the antiviral activity of MOV10. Importantly, cells depleted of endogenous UPF1, but not of another NMD core component, produce HIV-1 virions of substantially lower specific infectivity. The defect is at the level of reverse transcription, the same stage of the HIV-1 life cycle inhibited by ectopic MOV10. Thus, whereas ectopic MOV10 restricts HIV-1 replication, the related UPF1 helicase functions as a cofactor at an early post-entry step.},

Genetic disruptions and meiotic errors have important roles in infertility and the aetiology of developmental defects, especially aneuploidy.

Here, we describe the genomic analysis of one of the most frequent types of alternative pre-mRNA splicing, alternative 5\^{a}²- and 3\^{a}²-splice-site selection. Using an EST-based alternative splicing database recording >47,000 alternative splicing events, we determined the frequency and location of alternative 5\^{a}²- and 3\^{a}²-splice sites within the human genome. The most common alternative splice sites used in the human genome are located within 6 nucleotides (nt) of the dominant splice site. We show that the EST database overrepresents alternative splicing events that maintain the reading frame, thus supporting the concept that RNA quality-control steps ensure that mRNAs that encode for potentially harmful protein products are destroyed and do not serve as templates for translation. The most frequent location for alternative 5\^{a}²-splice sites is 4 nt upstream or downstream from the dominant splice site. Sequence analysis suggests that this preference is a consequence of the U1 snRNP binding sequence at the 5\^{a}²-splice site, which frequently contains a GU dinucleotide 4 nt downstream from the dominant splice site. Surprisingly, \^{a}¼50\% of duplicated 3\^{a}²-YAG splice junctions are subject to alternative splicing. This high probability of alternative 3\^{a}²-splice-site activation in close proximity of the dominant 3\^{a}²-splice site suggests that the second step of the splicing may be prone to violate splicing fidelity.},

We show that both binding and cleavage of DNA by Cas9-RNA require recognition of a short trinucleotide protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Non-target DNA binding affinity scales with PAM density, and sequences fully complementary to the guide RNA but lacking a nearby PAM are ignored by Cas9-RNA. Competition assays provide evidence that DNA strand separation and RNA-DNA heteroduplex formation initiate at the PAM and proceed directionally towards the distal end of the target sequence. Furthermore, PAM interactions trigger Cas9 catalytic activity. These results reveal how Cas9 uses PAM recognition to quickly identify potential target sites while scanning large DNA molecules, and to regulate scission of double-stranded DNA.},

Here we describe a robust mRNA-Seq protocol (Smart-Seq) that is applicable down to single cell levels. Compared with existing methods, Smart-Seq has improved read coverage across transcripts, which enhances detailed analyses of alternative transcript isoforms and identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We determined the sensitivity and quantitative accuracy of Smart-Seq for single-cell transcriptomics by evaluating it on total RNA dilution series. We found that although gene expression estimates from single cells have increased noise, hundreds of differentially expressed genes could be identified using few cells per cell type. Applying Smart-Seq to circulating tumor cells from melanomas, we identified distinct gene expression patterns, including candidate biomarkers for melanoma circulating tumor cells. Our protocol will be useful for addressing fundamental biological problems requiring genome-wide transcriptome profiling in rare cells.

abstract = {How species with similar repertoires of protein-coding genes differ so markedly at the phenotypic level is poorly understood. By comparing organ transcriptomes from vertebrate species spanning \~{}350 million years of evolution, we observed significant differences in alternative splicing complexity between vertebrate lineages, with the highest complexity in primates. Within 6 million years, the splicing profiles of physiologically equivalent organs diverged such that they are more strongly related to the identity of a species than they are to organ type. Most vertebrate species-specific splicing patterns are cis-directed. However, a subset of pronounced splicing changes are predicted to remodel protein interactions involving trans-acting regulators. These events likely further contributed to the diversification of splicing and other transcriptomic changes that underlie phenotypic differences among vertebrate species.},
annote = {From Spliceosomal pre-mRNA splicing book:
> Two recent studies investigating the evolution of alternative splicing in vertebrates found most alternative splicing to be more related to the species than to the organ type [ 22 , 23 ]. This result argues that many alternative events have recently evolved and that conservation may not be the most informative parameter used to determine if an alternative splicing event is important. Additionally, the authors observed that differences in alternative splicing con- tribute more signifi cantly to phenotypic variation than gene expres- sion levels [ 22 , 23 ].

abstract = {Dscam1 potentially encodes 19,008 ectodomains of a cell recognition molecule of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily through alternative splicing. Each ectodomain, comprising a unique combination of three variable (Ig) domains, exhibits isoform-specific homophilic binding in vitro. Although we have proposed that the ability of Dscam1 isoforms to distinguish between one another is crucial for neural circuit assembly, via a process called self-avoidance, whether recognition specificity is essential in vivo has not been addressed. Here we tackle this issue by assessing the function of Dscam1 isoforms with altered binding specificities. We generated pairs of chimeric isoforms that bind to each other (heterophilic) but not to themselves (homophilic). These isoforms failed to support self-avoidance or did so poorly. By contrast, coexpression of complementary isoforms within the same neuron restored self-avoidance. These data establish that recognition between Dscam1 isoforms on neurites of the same cell provides the molecular basis for self-avoidance.},

abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly dynamic structure that not only provides a physical framework for cells within connective tissues, but also imparts instructive signals for development, tissue homeostasis and basic cell functions through its composition and ability to exert mechanical forces. The ECM of tissues is composed of, in addition to proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid, a number of proteins, most of which are generated after alternative splicing of their pre-mRNA. However, the precise function of these protein isoforms is still obscure in most cases. Fibronectin (FN), one of the main components of the ECM, is also one of the best-known examples of a family of proteins generated by alternative splicing, having at least 20 different isoforms in humans. Over the last few years, considerable progress on elucidating the functions of the alternatively spliced FN isoforms has been achieved with the essential development of key engineered mouse strains. Here we summarize the phenotypes of the mouse strains having targeted mutations in the FN gene, which may lead to novel insights linking function of alternatively spliced isoforms of fibronectin to human pathologies.

Understanding the regulation of these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential isoform abundance in comparisons between conditions, cell types, or tissues. We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage in RNA-seq data. DEXSeq uses generalized linear models and offers reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account. DEXSeq detects with high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. We demonstrate the versatility of DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale. An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},

abstract = {Author SummaryIn most eukaryotic organisms, recombination—the exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosomes—ensures the proper recognition and segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. Recombination events in mammals are not randomly positioned along the chromosomes but occur in preferential 1–2-kilobase sequences termed hotspots. Different species such as humans and mice do not share hotspots, although the same principles almost certainly regulate their placement in the genome. Hotspot positions and activities depend on genetic background and show sex-specific differences. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of recombination activity along the largest mouse chromosome, finding that recombination is regulated on multiple levels, including regional positioning relative to the chromosomal ends, local gene content, sex-specific mechanisms of hotspot recognition, and parental origin. Our results will contribute to further understanding of one of the most fundamental biological processes and are likely to cast light on several aspects of population genetics and evolutionary biology, as well as enhance our practical ability to define the genetic components of human disease.},

The function and timing of expression of these three classes of small RNAs differ greatly. piRNAs are expressed and play a crucial role during male gametogenesis, whereas endo-siRNAs are essential for oocyte meiosis. By contrast, miRNAs are ubiquitously expressed in somatic tissues and function throughout post-implantation development. Surprisingly, however, miRNAs are non-essential during pre-implantation embryonic development and their function is suppressed during oocyte meiosis.

@article{Gesemann1995,
abstract = {Agrin is a basal lamina protein that induces aggregation of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and other molecules at the developing neuromuscular junction. Alternative splicing of chick agrin mRNA at two sites, A and B, gives rise to eight possible isoforms of which five are expressed in vivo. Motor neurons express high levels of isoforms with inserts at sites A and B, muscle cells synthesize isoforms that lack amino acids at the B-site. To obtain further insights into the mechanism of agrin-induced AChR aggregation, we have determined the EC50 (effective concentration to induce half-maximal AChR clustering) of each agrin isoform and of truncation mutants. On chick myotubes, EC50 of the COOH-terminal, 95-kD fragment of agrinA4B8 was approximately 35 pM, of agrinA4B19 approximately 110 pM and of agrinA4B11 approximately 5 nM. While some AChR clusters were observed with 64 nM of agrinA4B0, no activity was detected for agrinA0B0. Recombinant full-length chick agrin and a 100-kD fragment of ray agrin showed similar EC50 values. A 45-kD, COOH-terminal fragment of agrinA4B8 retained high activity (EC50 approximately equal to 130 pM) and a 21-kD fragment was still active, but required higher concentrations (EC50 approximately equal to 13 nM). Unlike the 45-kD fragment, the 21-kD fragment neither bound to heparin nor did heparin inhibit its capability to induce AChR aggregation. These data show quantitatively that agrinA4B8 and agrinA4B19, expressed in motor neurons, are most active, while no activity is detected in agrinA0B0, the dominant isoform synthesized by muscle cells. Furthermore, our results show that a fragment comprising site B8 and the most COOH-terminal G-like domain is sufficient for this activity, and that agrin domains required for binding to heparin and those for AChR aggregation are distinct from each other.},

abstract = {The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) addresses the evident requirement for quantitative data analysis in molecular medicine, biotechnology, microbiology and diagnostics and has become the method of choice for the quantification of mRNA. Although it is often described as a "gold" standard, it is far from being a standard assay. The significant problems caused by variability of RNA templates, assay designs and protocols, as well as inappropriate data normalization and inconsistent data analysis, are widely known but also widely disregarded. As a first step towards standardization, we describe a series of RT-qPCR protocols that illustrate the essential technical steps required to generate quantitative data that are reliable and reproducible. We would like to emphasize, however, that RT-qPCR data constitute only a snapshot of information regarding the quantity of a given transcript in a cell or tissue. Any assessment of the biological consequences of variable mRNA levels must include additional information regarding regulatory RNAs, protein levels and protein activity. The entire protocol described here, encompassing all stages from initial assay design to reliable qPCR data analysis, requires approximately 15 h.},

@article{Stamm2005,
abstract = {Alternative splicing is one of the most important mechanisms to generate a large number of mRNA and protein isoforms from the surprisingly low number of human genes. Unlike promoter activity, which primarily regulates the amount of transcripts, alternative splicing changes the structure of transcripts and their encoded proteins. Together with nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), at least 25\% of all alternative exons are predicted to regulate transcript abundance. Molecular analyses during the last decade demonstrate that alternative splicing determines the binding properties, intracellular localization, enzymatic activity, protein stability and posttranslational modifications of a large number of proteins. The magnitude of the effects range from a complete loss of function or acquisition of a new function to very subtle modulations, which are observed in the majority of cases reported. Alternative splicing factors regulate multiple pre-mRNAs and recent identification of physiological targets shows that a specific splicing factor regulates pre-mRNAs with coherent biological functions. Therefore, evidence is now accumulating that alternative splicing coordinates physiologically meaningful changes in protein isoform expression and is a key mechanism to generate the complex proteome of multicellular organisms.},

@article{Behrouzi2012,
abstract = {Summary
Noncoding RNAs form unique 3D structures, which perform many regulatory functions. To understand how RNAs fold uniquely despite a small number of tertiary interaction motifs, we mutated the major tertiary interactions in a group I ribozyme by single-base substitutions. The resulting perturbations to the folding energy landscape were measured using SAXS, ribozyme activity, hydroxyl radical footprinting, and native PAGE. Double- and triple-mutant cycles show that most tertiary interactions have a small effect on the stability of the native state. Instead, the formation of core and peripheral structural motifs is cooperatively linked in near-native folding intermediates, and this cooperativity depends on the native helix orientation. The emergence of a cooperative interaction network at an early stage of folding suppresses nonnative structures and guides the search for the native state. We suggest that cooperativity in noncoding RNAs arose from natural selection of architectures conducive to forming a unique, stable fold.},

@article{Franks2010,
abstract = {Summary
Cellular mRNAs exist in messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes, which undergo transitions during the lifetime of the mRNAs and direct posttranscriptional gene regulation. A final posttranscriptional step in gene expression is the turnover of the mRNP, which involves degradation of the mRNA and recycling of associated proteins. How tightly associated protein components are released from degrading mRNPs is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the ATPase activity of the RNA helicase Upf1 allows disassembly of mRNPs undergoing nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In the absence of Upf1 ATPase activity, partially degraded NMD mRNA intermediates accumulate in complex with NMD factors and concentrate in processing bodies. Thus, disassembly and completion of turnover of mRNPs undergoing NMD requires ATP hydrolysis by Upf1. This uncovers a previously unappreciated and potentially regulated step in mRNA decay and raises the question of how other mRNA decay pathways release protein components of substrate mRNPs.

Recently, the identification of a new type of RNA ligases in bacteria, archaea, and humans closed a long-standing gap in the field of tRNA processing. This review summarizes past and recent findings in the field of tRNA splicing with a focus on RNA ligation as it preferentially occurs in archaea and humans. In addition to providing an integrated view of the types and phyletic distribution of RNA ligase proteins known to date, this survey also aims at highlighting known and potential accessory biological functions of RNA ligases.},

Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.},

abstract = {piRNAs, a class of small non-coding RNAs associated with PIWI proteins, have broad functions in germline development, transposon silencing, and epigenetic regulation. In diverse organisms, a subset of piRNAs derived from repeat sequences are produced via the interplay between two PIWI proteins. This mechanism, termed “ping-pong” cycle, operates among the PIWI proteins of the primordial mouse testis; however, its involvement in postnatal testes remains elusive. Here we show that adult testicular piRNAs are produced independent of the ping-pong mechanism. We identified and characterized large populations of piRNAs in the adult and postnatal developing testes associated with MILI and MIWI, the only PIWI proteins detectable in these testes. No interaction between MILI and MIWI or sequence feature for the ping-pong mechanism among their piRNAs was detected in the adult testis. The majority of MILI- and MIWI-associated piRNAs originate from the same DNA strands within the same loci. Both populations of piRNAs are biased for 5′ Uracil but not for Adenine on the 10th nucleotide position, and display no complementarity. Furthermore, in Miwi mutants, MILI-associated piRNAs are not downregulated, but instead upregulated. These results indicate that the adult testicular piRNAs are predominantly, if not exclusively, produced by a primary processing mechanism instead of the ping-pong mechanism. In this primary pathway, biogenesis of MILI- and MIWI-associated piRNAs may compete for the same precursors; the types of piRNAs produced tend to be non-selectively dictated by the available precursors in the cell; and precursors with introns tend to be spliced before processed into piRNAs.},

We have confirmed several cases at the experimental level. Artifacts represent a significant portion of apparently spliced sequences using noncanonical splice signals but are rare in the context of the whole database. However, care should be taken in the annotation of alternative transcripts, especially when the RT used is poorly thermostable and when the putative intron is flanked by direct repeats, which are the substrate for template switching.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing generates functional diversity in higher organisms through alternative first and last exons, skipped and included exons, intron retentions and alternative donor, and acceptor sites. In large-scale microarray studies in humans and the mouse, emphasis so far has been placed on exon-skip events, leaving the prevalence and importance of other splice types largely unexplored. Using a new human splice variant database and a genome-wide microarray to probes thousands of splice events of each type, we measured differential expression of splice types across six pair of diverse cell lines and validated the database annotation process. Results suggest that splicing in humans is more complex than simple exon-skip events, which account for a minority of splicing differences. The relative frequency of differential expression of the splice types correlates with what is found by our annotation efforts. In conclusion, alternative splicing in human cells is considerably more complex than the canonical example of the exon skip. The complementary approaches of genome-wide annotation of alternative splicing in human and design of genome-wide splicing microarrays to measure differential splicing in biological samples provide a powerful high-throughput tool to study the role of alternative splicing in human biology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Antisense transcription in retroviruses has been suggested for both HIV-1 and HTLV-I, although the existence and coding potential of these transcripts remain controversial. Thorough characterization is required to demonstrate the existence of these transcripts and gain insight into their role in retrovirus biology.RESULTS:This report provides the first complete characterization of an antisense retroviral transcript that encodes the previously described HTLV-I HBZ protein. In this study, we show that HBZ-encoding transcripts initiate in the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) at several positions and consist of two alternatively spliced variants (SP1 and SP2). Expression of the most abundant HBZ spliced variant (SP1) could be detected in different HTLV-I-infected cell lines and importantly in cellular clones isolated from HTLV-I-infected patients. Polyadenylation of HBZ RNA occurred at a distance of 1450 nucleotides downstream of the HBZ stop codon in close proximity of a typical polyA signal. We have also determined that translation mostly initiates from the first exon located in the 3' LTR and that the HBZ isoform produced from the SP1 spliced variant demonstrated inhibition of Tax and c-Jun-dependent transcriptional activation.CONCLUSION:These results conclusively demonstrate the existence of antisense transcription in retroviruses, which likely plays a role in HTLV-I-associated pathogenesis through HBZ protein synthesis.},

abstract = {RNA polymerases are highly regulated molecular machines. We present a method (global run-on sequencing, GRO-seq) that maps the position, amount, and orientation of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases genome-wide. In this method, nuclear run-on RNA molecules are subjected to large-scale parallel sequencing and mapped to the genome. We show that peaks of promoter-proximal polymerase reside on approximately 30\% of human genes, transcription extends beyond pre-messenger RNA 3' cleavage, and antisense transcription is prevalent. Additionally, most promoters have an engaged polymerase upstream and in an orientation opposite to the annotated gene. This divergent polymerase is associated with active genes but does not elongate effectively beyond the promoter. These results imply that the interplay between polymerases and regulators over broad promoter regions dictates the orientation and efficiency of productive transcription.},

@article{Latham1996,
abstract = {We recently reported the cloning and sequencing of the mouse A-myb proto-oncogene cDNA and the abundant expression of this mRNA primarily in the testis of adult mice. The A-myb mRNA is detectable by in situ hybridization specifically in the spermatogenic cells, and is downregulated during terminal differentiation. A low level of expression is observed in a few other tissues, including ovary, spleen and brain. We have extended those studies by examining A-myb and B-myb expression during testis development in the mouse. The A-myb and B-myb genes are both expressed in a cell- and stage-specific manner during testis development. The B-myb mRNA is expressed most highly in gonocytes of the fetal testis and in spermatogonia and early spermatocytes in the adult. B-myb expression decreases at day 18 post partum, coincident with the initial appearance of late pachytene spermatocytes. B-myb expression was also detectable in some interstitial cells of the fetal and adult testis. The A-myb mRNA was not detectable by in situ hybridization in fetal day 15.5 gonocytes but was detectable at a low abundance by RT-PCR in fetal and newborn mice. A-myb mRNA expression increased at post-natal day 10, when primary spermatocytes first appear. In the adult, the A-myb mRNA was expressed highly in a sub-population of spermatogonia and in primary spermatocytes, but was not detectable in spermatids. This expression of A-myb is consistent with the meiotic arrest that is observed in A-myb-deficient male mice. We conclude that B-myb may play a critical role in controlling the proliferation or differentiation of gonocytes and spermatogonia and possibly the somatic lineages as well, whereas A-myb is required for progression through the first meiotic prophase. These distinct roles for B-myb and A-myb during spermatogenesis may reflect distinct transactivation potentials of the two proteins. Further studies to determine the functions of A-myb and B-myb in the developing testis should improve our understanding of the molecular events associated with spermatogenesis and differentiation of the Sertoli and other somatic cell types of the testis.},

Over the past three years, massively parallel DNA sequencing platforms have become widely available, reducing the cost of DNA sequencing by over two orders of magnitude, and democratizing the field by putting the sequencing capacity of a major genome center in the hands of individual investigators. These new technologies are rapidly evolving, and near-term challenges include the development of robust protocols for generating sequencing libraries, building effective new approaches to data-analysis, and often a rethinking of experimental design.

@book{Hertel,
abstract = {The splicing of nuclear pre-mRNAs is carried out by the spliceosome, which recognizes splicing signals and catalyzes the removal of noncoding intronic sequences to assemble protein coding sequences into mature mRNA prior to export and translation. Of the approximately 25,000 genes encoded by the human genome, more than 90 \% are believed to produce transcripts that are alternatively spliced. Thus, alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs can lead to the production of multiple protein isoforms from a single pre-mRNA, signifi - cantly enriching the proteomic diversity of higher eukaryotic organisms. Because regulation of this process can determine the timing and location that a particular protein isoform is produced, changes in alternative splicing patterns modulate many cellular activities. Consequently, the process of splicing must occur with a high degree of specifi city and fi delity to ensure the appropriate expression of functional mRNAs. Mutations in RNA splicing regulatory elements or in genes encoding splicing regulators that bind splicing regulatory elements can cause or modify the severity of disease. Early estimates, based on the identifi cation of mutations within splice sites, suggested that \~{}15 \% of all single base mutations change splicing patterns. However, it is now clear that many more mutations affect splicing by disrupting other important RNA elements, such as splicing enhancers or silencers binding sites. New estimates suggest that up to 60 \% of known mutations could cause disease through changes in pre-mRNA splicing. A signifi cant step towards identifying some of these disease-causing mutations has been made recently by combining novel high-throughput experimental and bioinformatic approaches to defi ne splicing patterns and splicing regulatory elements. The advent of novel methods to analyze the activities of the spliceosome has led to the merging of different analytical disciplines. The goal of this book is to provide the reader with a guide to classical experimental approaches to decipher splicing mechanisms and to provide experimental strategies that rely on novel multidisciplinary approaches. This book was written with graduate and medical students, clinicians, and postdoctoral researchers in mind. It describes the theory of alternative pre-mRNA splicing in seven introductory chapters and then introduces protocols and their theoretical background relevant for a variety of experimental research. These protocol chapters cover basic methods to detect splicing events, analyses of alternative pre-mRNA splicing in vitro and in vivo, manipulation of splicing events, and high-throughput and bioinformatic analyses of alternative splicing. Each chapter provides a theoretical introduction and a practical guide for molecular biologists, geneticists, clinicians, and every researcher interested in alternative splicing. In general, the protocols require a basic knowledge of molecular biology and/or RNA methods. The protocols in this book are a collection of commonly used methods in the fi eld of alternative splicing. These protocols should be viewed as guides for experiments that allow investigators to understand basic procedures. It is hoped that the chapters will allow readers to quickly fi nd the experimental tools necessary for their projects and that it will stimulate their interest in trying out other techniques. As such, I hope that this compendium of methods and protocols will help newcomers and seasoned molecular biologists to understand the fascinating world of alternative splicing with the ultimate goal of paving the way for many new discoveries to come.},

abstract = {In addition to sculpting eukaryotic transcripts by removing introns, pre-mRNA splicing greatly impacts protein composition of the emerging mRNP. The exon junction complex (EJC), deposited upstream of exon-exon junctions after splicing, is a major constituent of spliced mRNPs. Here, we report comprehensive analysis of the endogenous human EJC protein and RNA interactomes. We confirm that the major "canonical" EJC occupancy site in vivo lies 24 nucleotides upstream of exon junctions and that the majority of exon junctions carry an EJC. Unexpectedly, we find that endogenous EJCs multimerize with one another and with numerous SR proteins to form megadalton sized complexes in which SR proteins are super-stoichiometric to EJC core factors. This tight physical association may explain known functional parallels between EJCs and SR proteins. Further, their protection of long mRNA stretches from nuclease digestion suggests that endogenous EJCs and SR proteins cooperate to promote mRNA packaging and compaction.},

We describe the development of a potent antiplatelet agent, an RNA aptamer-termed Ch-9.14-T10 that binds von Willebrand factor (VWF) with high affinity and inhibits thrombosis in a murine carotid artery damage model. As expected, when this potent antiplatelet agent is administered, it greatly increases bleeding from animals that are surgically challenged. To improve this antiplatelet agent's safety profile, we describe the generation of antidotes that can rapidly reverse the activity of Ch-9.14-T10 and limit blood loss from surgically challenged animals. Our work represents the first antidote controllable antiplatelet agent, which could conceivably lead to improved medical management of patients requiring antiplatelet medication who also need surgery.},

We show here that binding in distal intronic regions (>500 nucleotides (nt) from any exon) by Rbfox splicing factors important in development is extensive and is an active mode of splicing regulation. Similarly to exon-proximal sites, distal sites contain evolutionarily conserved GCATG sequences and are associated with AS activation and repression upon modulation of Rbfox abundance in human and mouse experimental systems. As a proof of principle, we validated the activity of two specific Rbfox enhancers in KIF21A and ENAH distal introns and showed that a conserved long-range RNA-RNA base-pairing interaction (an RNA bridge) is necessary for Rbfox-mediated exon inclusion in the ENAH gene. Thus we demonstrate a previously unknown RNA-mediated mechanism for AS control by distally bound RNA-binding proteins.},

The popular MEME motif discovery algorithm is now complemented by the GLAM2 algorithm which allows discovery of motifs containing gaps. Three sequence scanning algorithms--MAST, FIMO and GLAM2SCAN--allow scanning numerous DNA and protein sequence databases for motifs discovered by MEME and GLAM2. Transcription factor motifs (including those discovered using MEME) can be compared with motifs in many popular motif databases using the motif database scanning algorithm TOMTOM. Transcription factor motifs can be further analyzed for putative function by association with Gene Ontology (GO) terms using the motif-GO term association tool GOMO. MEME output now contains sequence LOGOS for each discovered motif, as well as buttons to allow motifs to be conveniently submitted to the sequence and motif database scanning algorithms (MAST, FIMO and TOMTOM), or to GOMO, for further analysis. GLAM2 output similarly contains buttons for further analysis using GLAM2SCAN and for rerunning GLAM2 with different parameters. All of the motif-based tools are now implemented as web services via Opal. Source code, binaries and a web server are freely available for noncommercial use at http://meme.nbcr.net.},

abstract = {The four mammalian Argonaute family members are thought to share redundant functions in the microRNA pathway, yet only AGO2 possesses the catalytic "slicer" function required for RNAi. Whether AGO1, AGO3, or AGO4 possesses specialized functions remains unclear. Here we show that AGO4 localizes to spermatocyte nuclei during meiotic prophase I, specifically at sites of asynapsis and the transcriptionally silenced XY subdomain, the sex body. We generated Ago4 knockout mice and show that Ago4(-/-) spermatogonia initiate meiosis early, resulting from premature induction of retinoic acid-response genes. During prophase I, the sex body assembles incorrectly in Ago4(-/-) mice, leading to disrupted meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). This is associated with a dramatic loss of microRNAs, >20\% of which arises from the X chromosome. Thus, AGO4 regulates meiotic entry and MSCI in mammalian germ cells, implicating small RNA pathways in these processes.},

abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful tool for transcriptome profiling, but is hampered by sequence-dependent bias and inaccuracy at low copy numbers intrinsic to exponential PCR amplification. We developed a simple strategy for mitigating these complications, allowing truly digital RNA-Seq. Following reverse transcription, a large set of barcode sequences is added in excess, and nearly every cDNA molecule is uniquely labeled by random attachment of barcode sequences to both ends. After PCR, we applied paired-end deep sequencing to read the two barcodes and cDNA sequences. Rather than counting the number of reads, RNA abundance is measured based on the number of unique barcode sequences observed for a given cDNA sequence. We optimized the barcodes to be unambiguously identifiable, even in the presence of multiple sequencing errors. This method allows counting with single-copy resolution despite sequence-dependent bias and PCR-amplification noise, and is analogous to digital PCR but amendable to quantifying a whole transcriptome. We demonstrated transcriptome profiling of Escherichia coli with more accurate and reproducible quantification than conventional RNA-Seq.},

Critically, multiplex parallel sequencing applications methods rely on the use of barcoded primers for sample identification, and the quality of the barcodes directly impacts the quality of the resulting sequence data. Inspection of the recent publications reveals a surprisingly variable quality of the barcodes employed. Some barcodes are made in a semi empirical fashion, without quantitative consideration of error correction or minimal distance properties. After systematic comparison of published barcode sets, including commercially distributed barcoded primers from Illumina and Epicentre, methods for improved, Hamming code-based sequences are suggested and illustrated. Hamming barcodes can be employed for DNA tag designs in many different ways while preserving minimal distance and error-correcting properties. In addition, Hamming barcodes remain flexible with regard to essential biological parameters such as sequence redundancy and GC content. Wider adoption of improved Hamming barcodes is encouraged in multiplex parallel sequencing applications.},

Here we have used in vitro splicing reactions with different splicing reporter constructs to screen 4,000 chemical compounds for their ability to selectively inhibit spliceosome assembly and splicing. We discovered indole derivatives as potent inhibitors of the splicing reaction. Importantly, compounds of this family specifically inhibit exonic splicing enhancer (ESE)-dependent splicing, because they interact directly and selectively with members of the serine-arginine-rich protein family. Treatment of cells expressing reporter constructs with ESE sequences demonstrated that selected indole derivatives mediate inhibition of ESE usage in vivo and prevent early splicing events required for HIV replication. This discovery opens the exciting possibility of a causal pharmacological treatment of aberrant splicing in human genetic disorders and development of new antiviral therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {Plasma fibronectin is an acute-phase reactant synthesized by hepatocytes. Glucocorticoids are one of the major factors implicated in controlling the hepatic acute-phase response. To study the regulatory effects of glucocorticoids on plasma fibronectin biosynthesis, a model chick hepatocyte culture system under serum- and hormone-free conditions was used. In the presence of either dexamethasone or corticosterone, secreted plasma fibronectin increased maximally to 2.8-fold above basal levels. The stimulatory effect of the hormones was maintained only in their continuous presence, since plasma fibronectin production dropped to near basal levels within 16 h of glucocorticoid withdrawal. Pulse-chase studies indicated that pretreatment of cells with dexamethasone stimulated the level of secreted plasma fibronectin but had no effect on its rate of secretion. The increase in plasma fibronectin production by dexamethasone was abolished in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of progestin, an antagonist of dexamethasone known to compete specifically for the liver glucocorticoid receptor. Actinomycin D and alpha-amanitin, which are inhibitors of transcription, also blocked the early dexamethasone effect on plasma fibronectin synthesis. Slot blot hybridization of total RNA samples from dexamethasone-treated cultures revealed a 6-fold stimulatory rise in fibronectin mRNA during the first 6 h of treatment, which later declined and was no longer evident at 48 and 72 h. However, fibronectin mRNA levels were elevated to about the same extent in control and dexamethasone-treated cells at the later time points. During the same time period (0 to 72 h), plasma fibronectin protein levels rose and remained elevated. Evaluation of pulse-chase experiments following pretreatment with hormone for 48 h demonstrated that equal amounts of plasma fibronectin were translated by dexamethasone-treated and control cells, but only 42\% of labeled plasma fibronectin was secreted by control cells compared with 93\% for dexamethasone-treated cells. These findings suggest that the early phase of glucocorticoid regulation of plasma fibronectin biosynthesis occurs at the transcriptional level and is mediated through the specific action of the glucocorticoid receptor. A later phase of glucocorticoid-stimulated plasma fibronectin biosynthesis results from modulation of post-translational processing events leading to secretion of an increased amount of newly translated plasma fibronectin polypeptides.},

We use the unprecedented depth of coverage afforded by this technique to reach the deepest limits of the human transcriptome, exposing widespread, regulated and remarkably complex noncoding transcription in intergenic regions, as well as unannotated exons and splicing patterns in even intensively studied protein-coding loci such as p53 and HOX. The data also show that intermittent sequenced reads observed in conventional RNA sequencing data sets, previously dismissed as noise, are in fact indicative of unassembled rare transcripts.

Fossils can provide good "minimum" age estimates for branches in the tree, but "maximum" constraints on those ages are poorer. Current debates about which are the "best" fossil dates for calibration move to consideration of the most appropriate constraints on the ages of tree nodes. Because fossil-based dates are constraints, and because molecular evolution is not perfectly clock-like, analysts should use more rather than fewer dates, but there has to be a balance between many genes and few dates versus many dates and few genes. We provide "hard" minimum and "soft" maximum age constraints for 30 divergences among key genome model organisms; these should contribute to better understanding of the dating of the animal tree of life.},

abstract = {Cell recognition requires interactions through molecules located on cell surface. The insect homolog of Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) manifests huge molecular diversity in its extracellular domain. High-affinity Dscam-Dscam interactions only occur between isoforms that carry identical extracellular domains. Homophilic Dscam signaling can, thus, vary in strength depending on the compositions of Dscams present on the opposing cell surfaces. Dscam abundantly exists in the developing nervous system and governs arborization and proper elaboration of neurites. Notably, individual neurons may stochastically and dynamically express a small subset of Dscam isoforms such that any given neurite can be endowed with a unique repertoire of Dscams. This allows individual neurites to recognize their sister branches. Self-recognition leads to self-repulsion, ensuring divergent migration of sister processes. By contrast, weak homophilic Dscam interactions may promote fasciculation of neurites that express analogous, but not identical, Dscams. Differential Dscam binding may provide graded cell recognition that in turn governs complex neuronal morphogenesis.},
annote = {I just read the review by Shi and Lee in Sensing in Naure, 2012 Springer

        
What this article told me/reminded me was a few things I already knew

        
Dscam is important in :

        

        
   * Neuon self-avoidance
   * Dscam isoforms show strong binding when all three sites of AS are the same 
   * Strong binding leads to self avoidance and repulsion
   * This repulsion is important for proper development and neuon arborization
   * Sequence specific mechanisms are in place to help the cell select only 1 exon per bank
   * Band 4 exons are highly conserved, Bank 6 less so, and Bank 9 even less. 
   * The sequence of dscam exons is less important compared to the diversity of them
   * Flies need at least 5000 unique combinations to function.  Anything less and problems occur
   * If you force two neighboring cells to express the same Dscam isoform, they repulse each other
   * Cells express a stochastic yet biases repitore of \~{}50 Dscam isoforms (2004 Chess, Nature Genetics)

        
This quote is still important

        

        

        
IMPORTANT

        

        
It looks as though for SeqZip to have a real biological question type impact on Dscam I would have to fluroencetly tag a specific neuron, collect many copies of that neuron, and profile Dscam Isoforms expressed
or
I would have to get SeqZip to work from 1 cells worth of RNA

Squash associated physically with Piwi, and reductions in its expression led to modest transposon derepression without effects on piRNAs, consistent with an effector role. Alterations in Zucchini or Armitage reduced both Piwi protein and piRNAs, indicating functions in the formation of a stable Piwi RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex). Notably, loss of Zucchini or mutations within its catalytic domain led to accumulation of unprocessed precursor transcripts from flamenco, consistent with a role for this putative nuclease in piRNA biogenesis.},

A 5′ domain of HOTAIR binds polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), whereas a 3′ domain of HOTAIR binds the LSD1/CoREST/REST complex. The ability to tether two distinct complexes enables RNA-mediated assembly of PRC2 and LSD1 and coordinates targeting of PRC2 and LSD1 to chromatin for coupled histone H3 lysine 27 methylation and lysine 4 demethylation. Our results suggest that lincRNAs may serve as scaffolds by providing binding surfaces to assemble select histone modification enzymes, thereby specifying the pattern of histone modifications on target genes.},

abstract = {Small noncoding RNAs regulate processes essential for cell growth and development, including mRNA degradation, translational repression, and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS). During a search for candidate mammalian factors for TGS, we purified a complex that contains small RNAs and Riwi, the rat homolog to human Piwi. The RNAs, frequently 29 to 30 nucleotides in length, are called Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), 94\% of which map to 100 defined (< or = 101 kb) genomic regions. Within these regions, the piRNAs generally distribute across only one genomic strand or distribute on two strands but in a divergent, nonoverlapping manner. Preparations of piRNA complex (piRC) contain rRecQ1, which is homologous to qde-3 from Neurospora, a gene implicated in silencing pathways. Piwi has been genetically linked to TGS in flies, and slicer activity cofractionates with the purified complex. These results are consistent with a gene-silencing role for piRC in mammals.},

abstract = {Numerous genome-wide screens for polymorphisms that influence gene expression have provided key insights into the genetic control of transcription. Despite this work, the relevance of specific polymorphisms to in vivo expression and splicing remains unclear. We carried out the first genome-wide screen, to our knowledge, for SNPs that associate with alternative splicing and gene expression in human primary cells, evaluating 93 autopsy-collected cortical brain tissue samples with no defined neuropsychiatric condition and 80 peripheral blood mononucleated cell samples collected from living healthy donors. We identified 23 high confidence associations with total expression and 80 with alternative splicing as reflected by expression levels of specific exons. Fewer than 50\% of the implicated SNPs however show effects in both tissue types, reflecting strong evidence for distinct genetic control of splicing and expression in the two tissue types. The data generated here also suggest the possibility that splicing effects may be responsible for up to 13 out of 84 reported genome-wide significant associations with human traits. These results emphasize the importance of establishing a database of polymorphisms affecting splicing and expression in primary tissue types and suggest that splicing effects may be of more phenotypic significance than overall gene expression changes.},

At single-base resolution we discovered extensive, previously undetected DNA methylation, identified the context and level of methylation at each site, and observed local sequence effects upon methylation state. Deep sequencing of smRNAs revealed a direct relationship between the location of smRNAs and DNA methylation, perturbation of smRNA biogenesis upon loss of CpG DNA methylation, and a tendency for smRNAs to direct strand-specific DNA methylation in regions of RNA-DNA homology. Finally, strand-specific mRNA-seq revealed altered transcript abundance of hundreds of genes, transposons, and unannotated intergenic transcripts upon modification of the DNA methylation state.},

@article{Boutz2007,
abstract = {Many metazoan gene transcripts exhibit neuron-specific splicing patterns, but the developmental control of these splicing events is poorly understood. We show that the splicing of a large group of exons is reprogrammed during neuronal development by a switch in expression between two highly similar polypyrimidine tract-binding proteins, PTB and nPTB (neural PTB). PTB is a well-studied regulator of alternative splicing, but nPTB is a closely related paralog whose functional relationship to PTB is unknown. In the brain, nPTB protein is specifically expressed in post-mitotic neurons, whereas PTB is restricted to neuronal precursor cells (NPC), glia, and other nonneuronal cells. Interestingly, nPTB mRNA transcripts are found in NPCs and other nonneuronal cells, but in these cells nPTB protein expression is repressed. This repression is due in part to PTB-induced alternative splicing of nPTB mRNA, leading to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). However, we find that even properly spliced mRNA fails to express nPTB protein when PTB is present, indicating contributions from additional post-transcriptional mechanisms. The PTB-controlled repression of nPTB results in a mutually exclusive pattern of expression in the brain, where the loss of PTB in maturing neurons allows the synthesis of nPTB in these cells. To examine the consequences of this switch, we used splicing-sensitive microarrays to identify different sets of exons regulated by PTB, nPTB, or both proteins. During neuronal differentiation, the splicing of these exon sets is altered as predicted from the observed changes in PTB and nPTB expression. These data show that the post-transcriptional switch from PTB to nPTB controls a widespread alternative splicing program during neuronal development.},

abstract = {The central nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) regulator, Upf1, selectively targets nonsense-containing mRNAs for rapid degradation. In yeast, Upf1 preferentially associates with mRNAs that are NMD substrates, but the mechanism of its selective retention on these mRNAs has yet to be elucidated. Previously, we demonstrated that Upf1 associates with 40S ribosomal subunits. Here, we define more precisely the nature of this association using conventional and affinity-based purification of ribosomal subunits, and a two-hybrid screen to identify Upf1-interacting ribosomal proteins. Upf1 coimmunoprecipitates specifically with epitope-tagged 40S ribosomal subunits, and Upf1 association with high-salt washed or puromycin-released 40S subunits was found to occur without simultaneous eRF1, eRF3, Upf2, or Upf3 association. Two-hybrid analyses and in vitro binding assays identified a specific interaction between Upf1 and Rps26. Using mutations in domains of UPF1 known to be crucial for its function, we found that Upf1:40S association is modulated by ATP, and Upf1:Rps26 interaction is dependent on the N-terminal Upf1 CH domain. The specific association of Upf1 with the 40S subunit is consistent with the notion that this RNA helicase not only triggers rapid decay of nonsense-containing mRNAs, but may also have an important role in dissociation of the premature termination complex.},

abstract = {Using hybrid minigene experiments, we have investigated the role of the promoter architecture on the regulation of two alternative spliced exons, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) exon 9 and fibronectin extra domain-A (EDB). A specific alternative splicing pattern corresponded to each analyzed promoter. Promoter-dependent sensitivity to cotransfected regulatory splicing factor SF2/ASF was observed only for the CFTR exon 9, whereas that of the EDB was refractory to promoter-mediated regulation. Deletion in the CFTR minigene of the downstream intronic splicing silencer element binding SF2/ASF abolished the specific promoter-mediated response to this splicing factor. A systematic analysis of the regulatory cis-acting elements showed that in the presence of suboptimal splice sites or by deletion of exonic enhancer elements the promoter-dependent sensitivity to splicing factor-mediated inhibition was lost. However, the basal regulatory effect of each promoter was preserved. The complex relationships between the promoter-dependent sensitivity to SF2 modulated by the exon 9 definition suggest a kinetic model of promoter-dependent alternative splicing regulation that possibly involves differential RNA polymerase II elongation.},

Five of eleven tested mouse predictions were observed in human tissues, demonstrating that mouse transcripts provide a valuable resource for identifying alternative splicing events in human genes. Combining gene-specific measures of conserved and diverged alternative splicing with both gene classification based on Gene Ontology (GO) and microarray-determined gene expression in 52 diverse human tissues and cell lines, we found conserved alternative splicing most enriched in brain-expressed signaling pathways. Diverged alternative splicing is more prevalent in testis and cancerous cell line up-regulated processes, including protein biosynthesis, responses to stress and responses to endogenous stimuli. Using conservation as a surrogate for functional significance, these results suggest that alternative splicing plays an important role in enhancing the functional capacity of central nervous systems, while non-functional splicing more frequently occurs in testis and cell lines, possibly as a result of cellular stress and rapid proliferation.},

abstract = {Changes to the conformation of coding and non-coding RNAs form the basis of elements of genetic regulation and provide an important source of complexity, which drives many of the fundamental processes of life. Although the structure of RNA is highly flexible, the underlying dynamics of RNA are robust and are limited to transitions between the few conformations that preserve favourable base-pairing and stacking interactions. The mechanisms by which cellular processes harness the intrinsic dynamic behaviour of RNA and use it within functionally productive pathways are complex. The versatile functions and ease by which it is integrated into a wide variety of genetic circuits and biochemical pathways suggests there is a general and fundamental role for RNA dynamics in cellular processes.},

abstract = {Fibronectins (FNs) are multifunctional high molecular weight glycoproteins present in the blood plasma and in the ECMs of tissues. The FN primary transcript undergoes alternative splicing in three regions generating up to 20 main different variants in humans. However, the precise role of the FN isoforms is poorly understood. One of the alternatively spliced exons is the extra domain A (EDA) or extra type III homology that is regulated spatially and temporally during development and aging. To study its in vivo function, we generated mice devoid of EDA exon-regulated splicing. Constitutive exon inclusion was obtained by optimizing the splice sites, whereas complete exclusion was obtained after in vivo CRE-loxP–mediated deletion of the exon. Homozygous mouse strains with complete exclusion or inclusion of the EDA exon were viable and developed normally, indicating that the alternative splicing at the EDA exon is not necessary during embryonic development. Conversely, mice without the EDA exon in the FN protein displayed abnormal skin wound healing, whereas mice having constitutive inclusion of the EDA exon showed a major decrease in the FN levels in all tissues. Moreover, both mutant mouse strains have a significantly shorter lifespan than the control mice, suggesting that EDA splicing regulation is necessary for efficient long-term maintenance of biological functions.},

abstract = {In an attempt to synthesize an oligoribonucleotide by run-off transcription by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, a major transcript was produced that was much longer than expected. Analysis of the reaction indicated that the product resulted from initial DNA-directed run-off transcription followed by RNA template-directed RNA synthesis. This reaction occurred because the RNA made from the DNA template displayed self-complementarity at its 3' end and therefore could form an intra- or intermolecular primed template. In reactions containing only an RNA template, the rate of incorporation of NTPs was quite comparable to DNA-dependent transcription. RNA template-directed RNA synthesis has been found to occur with a great number of oligoribonucleotides, even with primed templates that are only marginally stable. In one instance, we observed a multistep extension reaction converting the oligonucleotide into a final product longer than twice its original length. Presumably, such a process could have generated some of the RNAs found to be efficiently replicated by T7 RNA polymerase.},

abstract = {Here we report that bacteriophage T4 RNA ligase 2 (Rnl2) is an efficient catalyst of RNA ligation at a 3'-OH/5'-PO(4) nick in a double-stranded RNA or an RNA.DNA hybrid. The critical role of the template strand in approximating the reactive 3'-OH and 5'-PO(4) termini is underscored by the drastic reductions in the RNA-sealing activity of Rnl2 when the duplex substrates contain gaps or flaps instead of nicks. RNA nick joining requires ATP and a divalent cation cofactor (either Mg or Mn). Neither dATP, GTP, CTP, nor UTP can substitute for ATP. We identify by alanine scanning seven functionally important amino acids (Tyr-5, Arg-33, Lys-54, Gln-106, Asp-135, Arg-155, and Ser-170) within the N-terminal nucleotidyl-transferase domain of Rnl2 and impute specific roles for these residues based on the crystal structure of the AMP-bound enzyme. Mutational analysis of 14 conserved residues in the C-terminal domain of Rnl2 identifies 3 amino acids (Arg-266, Asp-292, and Glu-296) as essential for ligase activity. Our findings consolidate the evolutionary connections between bacteriophage Rnl2 and the RNA-editing ligases of kinetoplastid protozoa.},

We applied this method to observe gene-expression changes in a colon cancer cell line cultured in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We generated more than 100 million 36-base TSS-tag sequences and revealed comprehensive features of hypoxia responsive alterations in the transcriptional landscape of the human genome. The features include presence of inducible ‘hot regions’ in 54 genomic regions, 220 novel hypoxia inducible promoters that may drive non-protein-coding transcripts, 191 hypoxia responsive alternative promoters and detailed views of 120 novel as well as known hypoxia responsive genes. We further analyzed hypoxic response of different cells using additional 60 million TSS-tags and found that the degree of the gene-expression changes were different among cell lines, possibly reflecting cellular robustness against hypoxia. The novel dynamic figure of the human gene transcriptome will deepen our understanding of the transcriptional program of the human genome as well as bringing new insights into the biology of cancer cells in hypoxia.},

abstract = {We have investigated whether transcriptional activators influence the efficiency of constitutive splicing and 3'-end formation, in addition to transcription levels. Remarkably, strong activators result in higher levels of splicing and 3'-cleavage than weak activators and can control the efficiency of these steps in pre-mRNA processing separately. The pre-mRNA processing stimulatory property of activators is dependent on their binding to promoters, but is not an indirect consequence of the levels of transcripts produced. Moreover, stimulation of splicing and cleavage by a strong activator operates by a mechanism that requires the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. The splicing stimulatory property of activators was observed for unrelated transcripts and for separate introns within a transcript, indicating a possible general role for strong activators in facilitating pre-mRNA processing levels. The results suggest that the efficiency of constitutive splicing and 3'-end cleavage is closely coordinated with transcription levels by promoter-bound activators.},

@article{Barrett2011a,
abstract = {A decade ago, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was established at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The original objective of GEO was to serve as a public repository for high-throughput gene expression data generated mostly by microarray technology. However, the research community quickly applied microarrays to non-gene-expression studies, including examination of genome copy number variation and genome-wide profiling of DNA-binding proteins. Because the GEO database was designed with a flexible structure, it was possible to quickly adapt the repository to store these data types. More recently, as the microarray community switches to next-generation sequencing technologies, GEO has again adapted to host these data sets. Today, GEO stores over 20,000 microarray- and sequence-based functional genomics studies, and continues to handle the majority of direct high-throughput data submissions from the research community. Multiple mechanisms are provided to help users effectively search, browse, download and visualize the data at the level of individual genes or entire studies. This paper describes recent database enhancements, including new search and data representation tools, as well as a brief review of how the community uses GEO data.

These isoforms include 19008 different ectodomains joined to one of two alternative transmembrane segments. Each ectodomain comprises a unique combination of three variable immunoglobulin domains. Biochemical studies support a model in which each isoform preferentially binds to the same isoform on opposing cell surfaces. This homophilic binding requires matching at all three variable immunoglobulin domains. These findings raise the intriguing possibility that specificity of binding by the Dscam isoforms mediates cell-surface recognition events required for wiring the fly brain.},

abstract = {Summary
Piwi proteins specify an animal-specific subclass of the Argonaute family that, in vertebrates, is specifically expressed in germ cells. We demonstrate that zebrafish Piwi (Ziwi) is expressed in both the male and the female gonad and is a component of a germline-specifying structure called nuage. Loss of Ziwi function results in a progressive loss of germ cells due to apoptosis during larval development. In animals that have reduced Ziwi function, germ cells are maintained but display abnormal levels of apoptosis in adults. In mammals, Piwi proteins associate with approximately 29-nucleotide-long, testis-specific RNA molecules called piRNAs. Here we show that zebrafish piRNAs are present in both ovary and testis. Many of these are derived from transposons, implicating a role for piRNAs in the silencing of repetitive elements in vertebrates. Furthermore, we show that piRNAs are Dicer independent and that their 3′ end likely carries a 2′O-Methyl modification.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION
Perhaps the most important and certainly the most often used technique in RNA analysis is gel electrophoresis. Because RNAs are negatively charged, they migrate toward the anode in the presence of electric current. The gel acts as a sieve to selectively impede the migration of the RNA in proportion to its mass, given that its mass is generally proportional to its charge. Because mass is approximately related to chain length, the length of an RNA is more generally determined by its migration. In addition, topology (i.e., circularity) can affect migration, making RNAs appear longer on the gel than they actually are. There are two common types of gel: polyacrylamide and agarose. For most applications involving RNAs of ≤600 nucleotides, denaturing acrylamide gels are most appropriate. In contrast, agarose gels are generally used to analyze RNAs of ≥600 nucleotides, and are especially useful for analysis of mRNAs (e.g., by Northern blotting). RNA analysis on agarose gels is essentially identical to DNA analysis (except that the gel boxes used must be dedicated to RNA work or to other ribonuclease-free work). Here we describe the use of straightforward Tris borate, EDTA (TBE) gels for routine analysis. These gels are appropriate for determining the quantity and integrity of RNA before using it for other applications. This procedure should not be used to determine size with accuracy, because the RNA will not remain in its extended state throughout the run.},

abstract = {Most human messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are alternatively spliced and many exhibit disease-specific splicing patterns. However, the contribution of most splicing events to the development and maintenance of human diseases remains unclear. As the contribution of alternative splicing events to diagnosis and prognosis is becoming increasingly recognized, it becomes important to develop precise methods to quantify the abundance of these isoforms in clinical samples. Here we present a pipeline for real-time PCR annotation of splicing events (RASE) that allows accurate identification of a large number of splicing isoforms in human tissues. The RASE automatically designed specific primer pairs for 81\% of all alternative splicing events in the NCBI build 36 database. Experimentally, the majority of the RASE designed primers resulted in isoform-specific amplification suitable for quantification in human cell lines or in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) RNA extract. Using this pipeline it is now possible to rapidly identify splicing isoform signatures in different types of human tissues or to validate complete sets of data generated by microarray expression profiling and deep sequencing techniques.},

While these methods are applicable to genome-wide analysis, it is often desirable to quantify expression of a more limited set of genes in hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of biological samples. For example, some studies may require monitoring a sizable panel of key genes under many different experimental conditions, during development, or following treatment with a large library of small molecules, for which current genome-wide methods are either inefficient or cost-prohibitive. This unit presents a method that permits quantitative profiling of several hundred selected genes in a large number of samples by coupling RNA-mediated oligonucleotide Annealing, Selection, and Ligation with Next-Gen sequencing (RASL-seq). The method even allows direct analysis of RNA levels in cell lysates and is also adaptable to full automation, making it ideal for large-scale analysis of multiple biological pathways or regulatory gene networks in the context of systematic genetic or chemical genetic perturbations.},

abstract = {RNA structure has critical roles in processes ranging from ligand sensing to the regulation of translation, polyadenylation and splicing. However, a lack of genome-wide in vivo RNA structural data has limited our understanding of how RNA structure regulates gene expression in living cells. Here we present a high-throughput, genome-wide in vivo RNA structure probing method, structure-seq, in which dimethyl sulphate methylation of unprotected adenines and cytosines is identified by next-generation sequencing. Application of this method to Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings yielded the first in vivo genome-wide RNA structure map at nucleotide resolution for any organism, with quantitative structural information across more than 10,000 transcripts. Our analysis reveals a three-nucleotide periodic repeat pattern in the structure of coding regions, as well as a less-structured region immediately upstream of the start codon, and shows that these features are strongly correlated with translation efficiency. We also find patterns of strong and weak secondary structure at sites of alternative polyadenylation, as well as strong secondary structure at 5' splice sites that correlates with unspliced events. Notably, in vivo structures of messenger RNAs annotated for stress responses are poorly predicted in silico, whereas mRNA structures of genes related to cell function maintenance are well predicted. Global comparison of several structural features between these two categories shows that the mRNAs associated with stress responses tend to have more single-strandedness, longer maximal loop length and higher free energy per nucleotide, features that may allow these RNAs to undergo conformational changes in response to environmental conditions. Structure-seq allows the RNA structurome and its biological roles to be interrogated on a genome-wide scale and should be applicable to any organism.},

Typically, this is done by inactivating individual genes and, subsequently, analyzing the phenotype of the modified organisms. In higher eukaryotes, where a tremendous amount of alternative splicing occurs, such approaches are not feasible because they have the potential to simultaneously affect multiple proteins that could have quite distinct and important functions. Thus, it is necessary to develop techniques that inactivate only a subset of proteins synthesized from genes encoding alternatively spliced mRNAs. Here we demonstrate that RNA interference (RNAi) can be used to selectively degrade specific alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms in cultured Drosophila cells. This is achieved by treating the cells with double-stranded RNA corresponding to an alternatively spliced exon. This technique may prove to be a powerful tool to assess the function of proteins synthesized from alternatively spliced mRNAs. In addition, these results have implications regarding the mechanism of RNAi in Drosophila.},

Here we report evidence that three-quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of previously unannotated RNAs.

@article{Mayr2009,
abstract = {In cancer cells, genetic alterations can activate proto-oncogenes, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis. However, the protein products of oncogenes are sometimes overexpressed without alteration of the proto-oncogene. Helping to explain this phenomenon, we found that when compared to similarly proliferating nontransformed cell lines, cancer cell lines often expressed substantial amounts of mRNA isoforms with shorter 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). These shorter isoforms usually resulted from alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA). The APA had functional consequences, with the shorter mRNA isoforms exhibiting increased stability and typically producing ten-fold more protein, in part through the loss of microRNA-mediated repression. Moreover, expression of the shorter mRNA isoform of the proto-oncogene IGF2BP1/IMP-1 led to far more oncogenic transformation than did expression of the full-length, annotated mRNA. The high incidence of APA in cancer cells, with consequent loss of 3'UTR repressive elements, suggests a pervasive role for APA in oncogene activation without genetic alteration.},

Here, we have immunopurified human Argonaute-1 and Argonaute-2 (AGO1 and AGO2) chromatin-embedded proteins and found them associated with chromatin modifiers and, notably, with splicing factors. Using the CD44 gene as a model, we show that AGO1 and AGO2 facilitate spliceosome recruitment and modulate RNA polymerase II elongation rate, thereby affecting alternative splicing. Proper AGO1 and AGO2 recruitment to CD44 transcribed regions required the endonuclease Dicer and the chromobox protein HP1$\gamma$, and resulted in increased histone H3 lysine 9 methylation on variant exons. Our data thus uncover a new model for the regulation of alternative splicing, in which Argonaute proteins couple RNA polymerase II elongation to chromatin modification.},

abstract = {In eukaryotes, U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) forms spliceosomes in equal stoichiometry with U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs; however, its abundance in human far exceeds that of the other snRNPs. Here we used antisense morpholino oligonucleotide to U1 snRNA to achieve functional U1 snRNP knockdown in HeLa cells, and identified accumulated unspliced pre-mRNAs by genomic tiling microarrays. In addition to inhibiting splicing, U1 snRNP knockdown caused premature cleavage and polyadenylation in numerous pre-mRNAs at cryptic polyadenylation signals, frequently in introns near (<5 kilobases) the start of the transcript. This did not occur when splicing was inhibited with U2 snRNA antisense morpholino oligonucleotide or the U2-snRNP-inactivating drug spliceostatin A unless U1 antisense morpholino oligonucleotide was also included. We further show that U1 snRNA–pre-mRNA base pairing was required to suppress premature cleavage and polyadenylation from nearby cryptic polyadenylation signals located in introns. These findings reveal a critical splicing-independent function for U1 snRNP in protecting the transcriptome, which we propose explains its overabundance.},

However, whether molecular diversity contributes to immune protection in invertebrates is unknown. We present evidence that Drosophila immune-competent cells have the potential to express more than 18,000 isoforms of the immunoglobulin (Ig)-superfamily receptor Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam). Secreted protein isoforms of Dscam were detected in the hemolymph, and hemocyte-specific loss of Dscam impaired the efficiency of phagocytic uptake of bacteria, possibly due to reduced bacterial binding. Importantly, the molecular diversity of Dscam transcripts generated through a mechanism of alternative splicing is highly conserved across major insect orders, suggesting an unsuspected molecular complexity of the innate immune system of insects.},

@article{Houseley2010a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trans-splicing, the in vivo joining of two independently transcribed RNA molecules, is well characterized in lower eukaryotes, but was long thought absent from metazoans. However, recent bioinformatic analyses of EST sequences suggested widespread trans-splicing in mammals. These apparently spliced transcripts generally lacked canonical splice sites, leading us to question their authenticity. Particularly, the native ability of reverse transcriptase enzymes to template switch during transcription could produce apparently trans-spliced sequences.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report an in vitro system for the analysis of template switching in reverse transcription. Using highly purified RNA substrates, we show the reproducible occurrence of apparent trans-splicing between two RNA molecules. Other reported non-canonical splicing events such as exon shuffling and sense-antisense fusions were also readily detected. The latter caused the production of apparent antisense non-coding RNAs, which are also reported to be abundant in humans.

CONCLUSIONS: We propose that most reported examples of non-canonical splicing in metazoans arise through template switching by reverse transcriptase during cDNA preparation. We further show that the products of template switching can vary between reverse transcriptases, providing a simple diagnostic for identifying many of these experimental artifacts.},

@article{DelaMata2003,
abstract = {Changes in promoter structure and occupation have been shown to modify the splicing pattern of several genes, evidencing a coupling between transcription and alternative splicing. It has been proposed that the promoter effect involves modulation of RNA pol II elongation rates. The C4 point mutation of the Drosophila pol II largest subunit confers on the enzyme a lower elongation rate. Here we show that expression of a human equivalent to Drosophila's C4 pol II in human cultured cells affects alternative splicing of the fibronectin EDI exon and adenovirus E1a pre-mRNA. Most importantly, resplicing of the Hox gene Ultrabithorax is stimulated in Drosophila embryos mutant for C4, which demonstrates the transcriptional control of alternative splicing on an endogenous gene. These results provide a direct proof for the elongation control of alternative splicing in vivo.},

In the present study, the mouse gene encoding Tudor domain containing protein 5 (TDRD5) was isolated from a 12.5-13.5 days post coitum (dpc) male-enriched subtracted cDNA library. Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis of Tdrd5 expression in the mouse embryonic gonad indicated that this gene is upregulated in the developing testis from 12.5 dpc, with expression levels remaining higher in testis than ovary throughout embryogenesis. Expression of Tdrd5 was absent in testes isolated from We/We embryos, which lack germ cells. In situ hybridization (ISH) on cryosectioned 13.5 dpc testes suggests that expression of Tdrd5, like that of Oct4, is restricted to germ cells. Northern hybridization analysis of expression in adult tissues indicated that Tdrd5 is expressed in the testis only, implying that expression of this gene is restricted to the male germline throughout development to adulthood.},

abstract = {Desert locusts \{(Schistocerca\} gregaria) show an extreme form of phenotypic plasticity and can transform between a cryptic solitarious phase and a swarming gregarious phase. The two phases differ extensively in behavior, morphology and physiology but very little is known about the molecular basis of these differences. We used our recently generated Expressed Sequence Tag \{(EST)\} database derived from S. gregaria central nervous system \{(CNS)\} to design oligonucleotide microarrays and compare the expression of thousands of genes in the \{CNS\} of long-term gregarious and solitarious adult desert locusts. This identified 214 differentially expressed genes, of which 40\% have been annotated to date. These include genes encoding proteins that are associated with \{CNS\} development and modeling, sensory perception, stress response and resistance, and fundamental cellular processes. Our microarray analysis has identified genes whose altered expression may enable locusts of either phase to deal with the different challenges they face. Genes for heat shock proteins and proteins which confer protection from infection were upregulated in gregarious locusts, which may allow them to respond to acute physiological challenges. By contrast the longer-lived solitarious locusts appear to be more strongly protected from the slowly accumulating effects of ageing by an upregulation of genes related to anti-oxidant systems, detoxification and anabolic renewal. Gregarious locusts also had a greater abundance of transcripts for proteins involved in sensory processing and in nervous system development and plasticity. Gregarious locusts live in a more complex sensory environment than solitarious locusts and may require a greater turnover of proteins involved in sensory transduction, and possibly greater neuronal plasticity.},

Crystal structures are reported for Rnl2 at discrete steps along this pathway: the covalent Rnl2-AMP intermediate; Rnl2 bound to an adenylylated nicked duplex, captured immediately following step 2; and Rnl2 at an adenylylated nick in a state poised for step 3. These structures illuminate the stereochemistry of nucleotidyl transfer and reveal how remodeling of active-site contacts and conformational changes propel the ligation reaction forward. Mutational analysis and comparison of nick-bound structures of Rnl2 and human DNA ligase I highlight common and divergent themes of substrate recognition that can explain their specialization for RNA versus DNA repair.},

There are a number of subtle yet crucial aspects of these analyses, such as read counting, appropriate treatment of biological variability, quality control checks and appropriate setup of statistical modeling. Several variations have been presented in the literature, and there is a need for guidance on current best practices. This protocol presents a state-of-the-art computational and statistical RNA-seq differential expression analysis workflow largely based on the free open-source R language and Bioconductor software and, in particular, on two widely used tools, DESeq and edgeR.

In particular, several evidences have suggested that silencers might have a fundamental role in preventing pseudoexon inclusion in mature transcripts and in defining constitutive exons by suppressing nearby decoy splice sites. Moreover, silencer elements allow the recruitment of regulatory factors to alternatively spliced exons, therefore participating in the modulation of alternative splicing pathways. Here we focus on splicing repression mechanisms in mammals, with particular concern to both exonic and intronic silencer elements, secondary structure formation and role in human genetic disease.Recently, in addition to the availability of a growing number of sequence elements deriving from the analysis of individual regulated exons, approaches have been developed that allowed the systematic identification of splicing silencers. These methods and are briefly described, as well as the motifs they retrieved, and summary of silenced exons is provided.},

abstract = {The arthropod Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) gene can generate tens of thousands of protein isoforms via combinatorial splicing of numerous alternative exons encoding immunoglobulin variable domains organized into three clusters referred to as the exon 4, 6, and 9 clusters. Dscam protein diversity is important for nervous system development and immune functions. We have performed extensive phylogenetic analyses of Dscam from 20 arthropods (each containing between 46 and 96 alternative exons) to reconstruct the detailed history of exon duplication and loss events that built this remarkable system over 450 million years of evolution. Whereas the structure of the exon 4 cluster is ancient, the exon 6 and 9 clusters have undergone massive, independent expansions in each insect lineage. An analysis of nearly 2000 duplicated exons enabled detailed reconstruction of the timing, location, and boundaries of these duplication events. These data clearly show that new Dscam exons have arisen continuously throughout arthropod evolution and that this process is still occurring in the exon 6 and 9 clusters. Recently duplicated regions display boundaries corresponding to a single exon and the adjacent intron. The boundaries, homology, location, clustering, and relative frequencies of these duplication events strongly suggest that staggered homologous recombination is the major mechanism by which new Dscam exons evolve. These data provide a remarkably detailed picture of how complex gene structure evolves and reveal the molecular mechanism behind this process.},

abstract = {We previously showed that the insertion of a hammerhead ribozyme (Rz) in a critical intronic position between the EDA exon and a downstream regulatory element affects alternative splicing. Here we evaluate the effect of other intronic cotranscriptional cleavage events on alternative pre-mRNA processing using different ribozymes (Rz) and Microprocessor target sequences (MTSs). In the context of the fibronectin EDA minigene, intronic MTSs were cleaved very inefficiently and did not affect alternative splicing or the level of mature transcripts. On the contrary, all hammerhead Rz derivatives and hepatitis $\delta$ Rz were completely cleaved before a splicing decision and able to affect alternative splicing. Despite the very efficient Rz-mediated cleavage, the levels of mature mRNA were only reduced to ∼40\%. We show that this effect on mature transcripts occurs regardless of the type and intronic position of Rzs, or changes in alternative splicing and exon definition. Thus, we suggest that intron integrity is not strictly required for splicing but is necessary for efficient pre-mRNA biosynthesis.},

@article{Roignant2010,
abstract = {<p>Summary<br/>The exon junction complex (EJC) is assembled on spliced mRNAs upstream of exon-exon junctions and can regulate their subsequent translation, localization, or degradation. We isolated mutations in Drosophila mago nashi (mago), which encodes a core EJC subunit, based on their unexpectedly specific effects on photoreceptor differentiation. Loss of Mago prevents epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, due to a large reduction in MAPK mRNA levels. MAPK expression also requires the EJC subunits Y14 and eIF4AIII and EJC-associated splicing factors. Mago depletion does not affect the transcription or stability of MAPK mRNA but alters its splicing pattern. MAPK expression from an exogenous promoter requires Mago only when the template includes introns. MAPK is the primary functional target of mago in eye development; in cultured cells, Mago knockdown disproportionately affects other large genes located in heterochromatin. These data support a nuclear role for EJC components in splicing a specific subset of introns.</p>},

The mammalian genome is extensively transcribed, giving rise to thousands of non-coding transcripts. Whether all of these transcripts are functional is debated, but it is evident that there are many functional large non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Recent studies have begun to explore the functional diversity and mechanistic role of these large ncRNAs. Here we synthesize these studies to provide an emerging model whereby large ncRNAs might achieve regulatory specificity through modularity, assembling diverse combinations of proteins and possibly RNA and DNA interactions.},

@article{Ward2009,
abstract = {Ninety-four percent of human genes are discontinuous, such that segments expressed as mRNA are contained within exons and separated by intervening segments, called introns. Following transcription, genes are expressed as precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs), which are spliced co-transcriptionally, and the flanking exons are joined together to form a continuous mRNA. One advantage of this architecture is that it allows alternative splicing by differential use of exons to generate multiple mRNAs from individual genes. Regulatory elements located within introns and exons guide the splicing complex, the spliceosome, and auxiliary RNA binding proteins to the correct sites for intron removal and exon joining. Misregulation of splicing and alternative splicing can result from mutations in cis-regulatory elements within the affected gene or from mutations that affect the activities of trans-acting factors that are components of the splicing machinery. Mutations that affect splicing can cause disease directly or contribute to the susceptibility or severity of disease. An understanding of the role of splicing in disease expands potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention by either directly addressing the cause or by providing novel approaches to circumvent disease processes.

This allows a more comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome, and in particular enables the study of alternative splicing, a gene regulation mechanism important in both normal conditions and in diseases. Some aspects of exon array data analysis are shared with those for standard gene expression data but others present new challenges that have required development of novel tools.

abstract = {The advent of powerful genomics technologies has uncovered many fundamental aspects of biology, including the mechanisms of cancer; however, it has not been appropriately matched by the development of global approaches to discover new medicines against human diseases. Here we describe a unique high-throughput screening strategy by high-throughput sequencing, referred to as HTS(2), to meet this challenge. This technology enables large-scale and quantitative analysis of gene matrices associated with specific disease phenotypes, therefore allowing screening for small molecules that can specifically intervene with disease-linked gene-expression events. By initially applying this multitarget strategy to the pressing problem of hormone-refractory prostate cancer, which tends to be accelerated by the current antiandrogen therapy, we identify Peruvoside, a cardiac glycoside, which can potently inhibit both androgen-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer cells without triggering severe cytotoxicity. We further show that, despite transcriptional reprogramming in prostate cancer cells at different disease stages, the compound can effectively block androgen receptor-dependent gene expression by inducing rapid androgen receptor degradation via the proteasome pathway. These findings establish a genomics-based phenotypic screening approach capable of quickly connecting pathways of phenotypic response to the molecular mechanism of drug action, thus offering a unique pathway-centric strategy for drug discovery.},

abstract = {T4 DNA ligase is one of the workhorses of molecular biology and used in various biotechnological applications. Here we report that this ligase, unlike Escherichia coli DNA ligase, Taq DNA ligase and Ampligase, is able to join the ends of single-stranded DNA in the absence of any duplex DNA structure at the ligation site. Such nontemplated ligation of DNA oligomers catalyzed by T4 DNA ligase occurs with a very low yield, as assessed by quantitative competitive PCR, between 10−6 and 10−4 at oligonucleotide concentrations in the range 0.1–10 nm, and thus is insignificant in many molecular biological applications of T4 DNA ligase. However, this side reaction may be of paramount importance for diagnostic detection methods that rely on template-dependent or target-dependent DNA probe ligation in combination with amplification techniques, such as PCR or rolling-circle amplification, because it can lead to nonspecific background signals or false positives. Comparison of ligation yields obtained with substrates differing in their strandedness at the terminal segments involved in ligation shows that an acceptor duplex DNA segment bearing a 3′-hydroxy end, but lacking a 5′-phosphate end, is sufficient to play a role as a cofactor in blunt-end ligation.},

The last few years have witnessed a rapid increase in studies on how and when ICRs become marked by and subsequently maintain such epigenetic modifications. These novel findings are summarised in this review, which focuses on the germline acquisition of DNA methylation imprints and particularly on the combined role of primary sequence specificity, chromatin configuration, non-histone proteins and transcriptional events.},

abstract = {U1 snRNP (U1), in addition to its splicing role, protects pre-mRNAs from drastic premature termination by cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA) at cryptic polyadenylation signals (PASs) in introns. Here, a high-throughput sequencing strategy of differentially expressed transcripts (HIDE-seq) mapped PCPA sites genome wide in divergent organisms. Surprisingly, whereas U1 depletion terminated most nascent gene transcripts within \~{}1 kb, moderate functional U1 level decreases, insufficient to inhibit splicing, dose-dependently shifted PCPA downstream and elicited mRNA 3' UTR shortening and proximal 3' exon switching characteristic of activated immune and neuronal cells, stem cells, and cancer. Activated neurons' signature mRNA shortening could be recapitulated by U1 decrease and antagonized by U1 overexpression. Importantly, we show that rapid and transient transcriptional upregulation inherent to neuronal activation physiology creates U1 shortage relative to pre-mRNAs. Additional experiments suggest cotranscriptional PCPA counteracted by U1 association with nascent transcripts, a process we term telescripting, ensuring transcriptome integrity and regulating mRNA length.},

abstract = {A novel template design for single-molecule sequencing is introduced, a structure we refer to as a SMRTbell™ template. This structure consists of a double-stranded portion, containing the insert of interest, and a single-stranded hairpin loop on either end, which provides a site for primer binding. Structurally, this format resembles a linear double-stranded molecule, and yet it is topologically circular. When placed into a single-molecule sequencing reaction, the SMRTbell template format enables a consensus sequence to be obtained from multiple passes on a single molecule. Furthermore, this consensus sequence is obtained from both the sense and antisense strands of the insert region. In this article, we present a universal method for constructing these templates, as well as an application of their use. We demonstrate the generation of high-quality consensus accuracy from single molecules, as well as the use of SMRTbell templates in the identification of rare sequence variants.},

Recent progress in high-throughput sequencing has uncovered an astounding landscape of small RNAs in eukaryotic cells. Various small RNAs of distinctive characteristics have been found and can be classified into three classes based on their biogenesis mechanism and the type of Argonaute protein that they are associated with: microRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs or esiRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). This Review summarizes our current knowledge of how these intriguing molecules are generated in animal cells.},

abstract = {T4 RNA ligase 2 (Rnl2) repairs 3'-OH/5'-PO4 nicks in duplex nucleic acids in which the broken 3'-OH strand is RNA. Ligation entails three chemical steps: reaction of Rnl2 with ATP to form a covalent Rnl2-(lysyl-N$\zeta$)-AMP intermediate (step 1); transfer of AMP to the 5'-PO4 of the nick to form an activated AppN- intermediate (step 2); and attack by the nick 3'-OH on the AppN- strand to form a 3'-5' phosphodiester (step 3). Here we used rapid mix-quench methods to analyze the kinetic mechanism and fidelity of single-turnover nick sealing by Rnl2-AMP. For substrates with correctly base-paired 3'-OH nick termini, kstep2 was fast (9.5 to 17.9 sec(-1)) and similar in magnitude to kstep3 (7.9 to 32 sec(-1)). Rnl2 fidelity was enforced mainly at the level of step 2 catalysis, whereby 3'-OH base mispairs and oxoguanine, oxoadenine, or abasic lesions opposite the nick 3'-OH elicited severe decrements in the rate of 5'-adenylylation and relatively modest slowing of the rate of phosphodiester synthesis. The exception was the noncanonical A:oxoG base pair, which Rnl2 accepted as a correctly paired end for rapid sealing. These results underscore (1) how Rnl2 requires proper positioning of the 3'-terminal ribonucleoside at the nick for optimal 5'-adenylylation and (2) the potential for nick-sealing ligases to embed mutations during the repair of oxidative damage.},

abstract = {A paramutation is an epigenetic interaction between two alleles of a locus, through which one allele induces a heritable modification in the other allele without modifying the DNA sequence. The paramutated allele itself becomes paramutagenic, that is, capable of epigenetically converting a new paramutable allele. Here we describe a case of paramutation in animals showing long-term transmission over generations. We previously characterized a homology-dependent silencing mechanism referred to as the trans-silencing effect (TSE), involved in P-transposable-element repression in the germ line. We now show that clusters of P-element-derived transgenes that induce strong TSE can convert other homologous transgene clusters incapable of TSE into strong silencers, which transmit the acquired silencing capacity through 50 generations. The paramutation occurs without any need for chromosome pairing between the paramutagenic and the paramutated loci, and is mediated by maternal inheritance of cytoplasm carrying Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) homologous to the transgenes. The repression capacity of the paramutated locus is abolished by a loss-of-function mutation of the aubergine gene involved in piRNA biogenesis, but not by a loss-of-function mutation of the Dicer-2 gene involved in siRNA production. The paramutated cluster, previously producing barely detectable levels of piRNAs, is converted into a stable, strong piRNA-producing locus by the paramutation and becomes fully paramutagenic itself. Our work provides a genetic model for the emergence of piRNA loci, as well as for RNA-mediated trans-generational repression of transposable elements.},

abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster cell lines are important resources for cell biologists. Here, we catalog the expression of exons, genes, and unannotated transcriptional signals for 25 lines. Unannotated transcription is substantial (typically 19\% of euchromatic signal). Conservatively, we identify 1405 novel transcribed regions; 684 of these appear to be new exons of neighboring, often distant, genes. Sixty-four percent of genes are expressed detectably in at least one line, but only 21\% are detected in all lines. Each cell line expresses, on average, 5885 genes, including a common set of 3109. Expression levels vary over several orders of magnitude. Major signaling pathways are well represented: most differentiation pathways are "off" and survival/growth pathways "on." Roughly 50\% of the genes expressed by each line are not part of the common set, and these show considerable individuality. Thirty-one percent are expressed at a higher level in at least one cell line than in any single developmental stage, suggesting that each line is enriched for genes characteristic of small sets of cells. Most remarkable is that imaginal disc-derived lines can generally be assigned, on the basis of expression, to small territories within developing discs. These mappings reveal unexpected stability of even fine-grained spatial determination. No two cell lines show identical transcription factor expression. We conclude that each line has retained features of an individual founder cell superimposed on a common "cell line" gene expression pattern.},

Here we describe 'high-throughput sequencing'-'fluorescent ligand interaction profiling' (HiTS-FLIP), a technique for measuring quantitative protein-DNA binding affinity at unprecedented depth. In this approach, the optics built into a high-throughput sequencer are used to visualize in vitro binding of a protein to sequenced DNA in a flow cell. Application of HiTS-FLIP to the protein Gcn4 (Gcn4p), the master regulator of the yeast amino acid starvation response, yielded \~{}440 million binding measurements, enabling determination of dissociation constants for all 12-mer sequences having submicromolar affinity. These data revealed a complex interdependency between motif positions, allowed improved discrimination of in vivo Gcn4p binding sites and regulatory targets relative to previous methods and showed that sets of genes with different promoter affinities to Gcn4p have distinct functions and expression kinetics. Broad application of this approach should increase understanding of the interactions that drive transcription.},

@article{Wilhelm2009,
abstract = {The ability to quantitatively survey the global behavior of transcriptomes has been a key milestone in the field of systems biology, enabled by the advent of DNA microarrays. While this approach has literally transformed our vision and approach to cellular physiology, microarray technology has always been limited by the requirement to decide, a priori, what regions of the genome to examine. While very high density tiling arrays have reduced this limitation for simpler organisms, it remains an obstacle for larger, more complex, eukaryotic genomes. The recent development of "next-generation" massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies by companies such as Roche (454 GS FLX), Illumina (Genome Analyzer II), and ABI (AB SOLiD) has completely transformed the way in which quantitative transcriptomics can be done. These new technologies have reduced both the cost-per-reaction and time required by orders of magnitude, making the use of sequencing a cost-effective option for many experimental approaches. One such method that has recently been developed uses MPS technology to directly survey the RNA content of cells, without requiring any of the traditional cloning associated with EST sequencing. This approach, called "RNA-seq", can generate quantitative expression scores that are comparable to microarrays, with the added benefit that the entire transcriptome is surveyed without the requirement of a priori knowledge of transcribed regions. The important advantage of this technique is that not only can quantitative expression measures be made, but transcript structures including alternatively spliced transcript isoforms, can also be identified. This article discusses the experimental approach for both sample preparation and data analysis for the technique of RNA-seq.},

abstract = {Drosophila Dscam encodes a vast family of immunoglobulin (Ig)-containing proteins that exhibit isoform-specific homophilic binding. This diversity is essential for cell recognition events required for wiring the brain. Each isoform binds to itself but rarely to other isoforms. Specificity is determined by "matching" of three variable Ig domains within an approximately 220 kD ectodomain. Here, we present the structure of the homophilic binding region of Dscam, comprising the eight N-terminal Ig domains (Dscam(1-8)). Dscam(1-8) forms a symmetric homodimer of S-shaped molecules. This conformation, comprising two reverse turns, allows each pair of the three variable domains to "match" in an antiparallel fashion. Structural, genetic, and biochemical studies demonstrate that, in addition to variable domain "matching," intramolecular interactions between constant domains promote homophilic binding. These studies provide insight into how "matching" at all three pairs of variable domains in Dscam mediates isoform-specific recognition.},

abstract = {By analyzing 1,780,295 5'-end sequences of human full-length cDNAs derived from 164 kinds of oligo-cap cDNA libraries, we identified 269,774 independent positions of transcriptional start sites (TSSs) for 14,628 human RefSeq genes. These TSSs were clustered into 30,964 clusters that were separated from each other by more than 500 bp and thus are very likely to constitute mutually distinct alternative promoters. To our surprise, at least 7674 (52\%) human RefSeq genes were subject to regulation by putative alternative promoters (PAPs). On average, there were 3.1 PAPs per gene, with the composition of one CpG-island-containing promoter per 2.6 CpG-less promoters. In 17\% of the PAP-containing loci, tissue-specific use of the PAPs was observed. The richest tissue sources of the tissue-specific PAPs were testis and brain. It was also intriguing that the PAP-containing promoters were enriched in the genes encoding signal transduction-related proteins and were rarer in the genes encoding extracellular proteins, possibly reflecting the varied functional requirement for and the restricted expression of those categories of genes, respectively. The patterns of the first exons were highly diverse as well. On average, there were 7.7 different splicing types of first exons per locus partly produced by the PAPs, suggesting that a wide variety of transcripts can be achieved by this mechanism. Our findings suggest that use of alternate promoters and consequent alternative use of first exons should play a pivotal role in generating the complexity required for the highly elaborated molecular systems in humans.},

abstract = {The CD45 Ag family is comprised of at least five isoforms generated by the alternative splicing of three exons encoded by a single leukocyte common Ag gene. These isoforms, differentially expressed on subsets of T cells, are widely believed to delineate maturational status. Thus, cells expressing the high molecular mass CD45RA+ isoforms (220 and 205 kDa) are believed to represent naive cells, whereas those lacking CD45RA and expressing high density CD45RO (180 kDa) represent memory cells. This is based on findings that after activation, CD45RA+ cells "convert" to the CD45RA- phenotype, losing CD45RA and gaining CD45RO. This conversion is believed to be both unidirectional and irreversible. We now report a strategy for the development of polyclonal CD45RA+ cell lines derived from peripheral blood CD4+CD45RA+ cells. However, in such cell lines, CD45RA expression was not constant, but varied cyclically with restimulation. After restimulation, CD45RA expression decreased significantly, nadiring on days 5 to 7. However, CD45RA was fully re-expressed by days 14 to 16. These cells coexpressed high density CD45RO, which did not vary through the stimulatory cycle. Cells sorted CD45RA- on day 7 of the cycle rapidly reexpress CD45RA. Metabolic labeling revealed that the 220 kDa CD45RA isoform is no longer synthesized. Synthesis of the 205 kDa (CD45RA) isoform decreased significantly early after stimulation, but then increased back to baseline after day 12. The 180-kDa (CD45RO) isoform followed an opposite pattern. Our results document that alternative splicing of the different CD45 isoforms is highly regulated after activation and that conversion from CD45RA+ to CD45RA- is neither unidirectional, nor irreversible.},

abstract = {Summary
The selective degradation of mRNAs by the nonsense-mediated decay pathway is a quality control process with important consequences for human disease. From initial studies using RNA hairpin-tagged mRNAs for purification of messenger ribonucleoproteins assembled on transcripts with HIV-1 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) sequences, we uncover a two-step mechanism for Upf1-dependent degradation of mRNAs with long 3′UTRs. We demonstrate that Upf1 associates with mRNAs in a 3′UTR length-dependent manner and is highly enriched on transcripts containing 3′UTRs known to elicit NMD. Surprisingly, Upf1 recruitment and subsequent RNA decay can be antagonized by retroviral RNA elements that promote translational readthrough. By modulating the efficiency of translation termination, recognition of long 3′UTRs by Upf1 is uncoupled from the initiation of decay. We propose a model for 3′UTR length surveillance in which equilibrium binding of Upf1 to mRNAs precedes a kinetically distinct commitment to RNA decay.},

abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq mammalian transcriptome studies are at an early stage in uncovering cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, transcript processing and editing, and regulatory module activity. Despite great progress recently, substantial challenges remain, including discriminating biological variation from technical noise. Here we apply the SMART-seq single-cell RNA-seq protocol to study the reference lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878. By using spike-in quantification standards we estimate the absolute number of RNA molecules per cell for each gene and find significant variation in total mRNA content, between 50,000 to 300,000 transcripts per cell. We directly measure technical stochasticity by a pool/spilt design, and find that there are significant differences in expression between individual cells, over and above technical variation. Specific gene coexpression modules were preferentially expressed in subsets of individual cells, including one enriched for mRNA processing and splicing factors. We assess cell-to-cell variation in alternative splicing and allelic bias, and report evidence of significant differences in splice site usage that exceed splice variation in the pool/split comparison. Finally, we show that transcriptomes from small pools of 30-100 cells approach the information content and reproducibility of contemporary RNA-seq from large amounts of input material. Together, our results define an experimental and computational path forward for analyzing gene expression in rare cell types and cell states.},

Evolutionary studies of AS have focused primarily on the conservation of alternatively spliced sequences or of the AS pattern of those sequences itself. Less is known about the evolution of the regulation of AS, but several studies, working from different perspectives, have recently made significant progress. Here, we categorize the different levels of AS evolution, and summarize the studies on evolution of AS regulation, which point to a high level of evolutionary conservation of the regulation of AS events conserved between related species. This suggests that the quantitative regulation of AS is an intrinsic part of AS function. We discuss the potential role of changes in developmental regulation of AS as an additional layer in complex gene regulatory networks and in the emergence of genetic novelties.},

abstract = {Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and digital imaging microscopy were modified to allow detection of single RNA molecules. Oligodeoxynucleotide probes were synthesized with five fluorochromes per molecule, and the light emitted by a single probe was calibrated. Points of light in exhaustively deconvolved images of hybridized cells gave fluorescent intensities and distances between probes consistent with single messenger RNA molecules. Analysis of $\beta$-actin transcription sites after serum induction revealed synchronous and cyclical transcription from single genes. The rates of transcription initiation and termination and messenger RNA processing could be determined by positioning probes along the transcription unit. This approach extends the power of FISH to yield quantitative molecular information on a single cell.},

abstract = {Motivation: Many programs for aligning short sequencing reads to a reference genome have been developed in the last 2 years. Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads >200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashing-based software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time.Results: We designed and implemented a new algorithm, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner's Smith-Waterman Alignment (BWA-SW), to align long sequences up to 1 Mb against a large sequence database (e.g. the human genome) with a few gigabytes of memory. The algorithm is as accurate as SSAHA2, more accurate than BLAT, and is several to tens of times faster than both.Availability: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.netContact: rd@sanger.ac.uk},

@article{Mudge2013b,
abstract = {The last decade has seen tremendous effort committed to the annotation of the human genome sequence, most notably perhaps in the form of the ENCODE project. One of the major findings of ENCODE, and other genome analysis projects, is that the human transcriptome is far larger and more complex than previously thought. This complexity manifests, for example, as alternative splicing within protein-coding genes, as well as in the discovery of thousands of long noncoding RNAs. It is also possible that significant numbers of human transcripts have not yet been described by annotation projects, while existing transcript models are frequently incomplete. The question as to what proportion of this complexity is truly functional remains open, however, and this ambiguity presents a serious challenge to genome scientists. In this article, we will discuss the current state of human transcriptome annotation, drawing on our experience gained in generating the GENCODE gene annotation set. We highlight the gaps in our knowledge of transcript functionality that remain, and consider the potential computational and experimental strategies that can be used to help close them. We propose that an understanding of the true overlap between transcriptional complexity and functionality will not be gained in the short term. However, significant steps toward obtaining this knowledge can now be taken by using an integrated strategy, combining all of the experimental resources at our disposal.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, genome-wide transcriptomic studies have shown that the mammalian genome is pervasively transcribed and produces many thousands of transcriptomes without bias from previous genome annotations. This finding, together with the discovery of a plethora of unexpected RNAs that have no obvious coding capacities, have challenged the traditional views that proteins are the main protagonists of cellular functions and that RNA is merely an intermediary between DNA sequence and its encoded protein. There are many different kinds of products that are generated by this pervasive transcription; this review focuses on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that have shown spatial and temporal specific patterns of expression and regulation in a wide variety of cells and tissues, adding significant complexity to the understanding of their biological roles. Recent research has shed new light onto the biological function significance of lncRNAs. Here, we review the rapidly advancing field of lncRNAs, describing their biological features and their roles in regulation of gene expression. Moreover, we highlight some recent advances in our understanding of ncRNA-mediated regulation of stem cell pluripotency, morphogenesis, and development, focusing mainly on the regulatory roles of lncRNAs. Finally, we consider the potential medical implications, and the potential use of lncRNAs in drug development and discovery and in the identification of molecular markers of diseases, including cancer.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is highly dynamic during mammalian embryogenesis. It is broadly accepted that the paternal genome is actively depleted of 5-methylcytosine at fertilization, followed by passive loss that reaches a minimum at the blastocyst stage. However, this model is based on limited data, and so far no base-resolution maps exist to support and refine it. Here we generate genome-scale DNA methylation maps in mouse gametes and from the zygote through post-implantation. We find that the oocyte already exhibits global hypomethylation, particularly at specific families of long interspersed element 1 and long terminal repeat retroelements, which are disparately methylated between gametes and have lower methylation values in the zygote than in sperm. Surprisingly, the oocyte contributes a unique set of differentially methylated regions (DMRs)—including many CpG island promoters—that are maintained in the early embryo but are lost upon specification and absent from somatic cells. In contrast, sperm-contributed DMRs are largely intergenic and become hypermethylated after the blastocyst stage. Our data provide a genome-scale, base-resolution timeline of DNA methylation in the pre-specified embryo, when this epigenetic modification is most dynamic, before returning to the canonical somatic pattern.},

abstract = {PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) silence transposons to maintain genome integrity in animal germ lines. piRNAs are classified as primary and secondary piRNAs, depending on their biogenesis machinery. Primary piRNAs are processed from long non-coding RNA precursors transcribed from piRNA clusters in the genome through the primary processing pathway. Although the existence of a ribonuclease participating in this pathway has been predicted, its molecular identity remained unknown. Here we show that Zucchini (Zuc), a mitochondrial phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily member, is an endoribonuclease essential for primary piRNA biogenesis. We solved the crystal structure of Drosophila melanogaster Zuc (DmZuc) at 1.75 \AA resolution. The structure revealed that DmZuc has a positively charged, narrow catalytic groove at the dimer interface, which could accommodate a single-stranded, but not a double-stranded, RNA. DmZuc and the mouse homologue MmZuc (also known as Pld6 and MitoPLD) showed endoribonuclease activity for single-stranded RNAs in vitro. The RNA cleavage products bear a 5'-monophosphate group, a hallmark of mature piRNAs. Mutational analyses revealed that the conserved active-site residues of DmZuc are critical for the ribonuclease activity in vitro, and for piRNA maturation and transposon silencing in vivo. We propose a model for piRNA biogenesis in animal germ lines, in which the Zuc endoribonuclease has a key role in primary piRNA maturation.},

Ligase-mediated gene detection allows precise distinction of DNA sequence variants, but it is not known if ligases can also be used to distinguish variants of RNA sequences. Here we present conditions for efficient ligation of pairs of DNA oligonucleotides hybridizing next to one another on RNA strands, permitting discrimination of any single nucleotide probe-target mismatch by a factor of between 20- and 200-fold. The mechanism allows padlock probes to be used to distinguish single-nucleotide variants in RNA. Ligase-mediated gene detection could therefore provide highly sensitive and accurate ligase-mediated detection and distinction of RNA sequence variants in solution, on DNA microarrays, and in situ.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing creates diverse mRNA isoforms from single genes and thereby enhances complexity of transcript structure and of gene function. We describe a method called spliceotyping, which translates combinatorial mRNA splicing patterns along transcripts into a library of binary strings of nucleic acid tags that encode the exon composition of individual mRNA molecules. The exon inclusion pattern of each analyzed transcript is thus represented as binary data, and the abundance of different splice variants is registered by counts of individual molecules. The technique is illustrated in a model experiment by analyzing the splicing patterns of the adenovirus early 1A gene and the beta actin reference transcript. The method permits many genes to be analyzed in parallel and it will be valuable for elucidating the complex effects of combinatorial splicing.},

abstract = {With an ever increasing number of people taking numerous medications, the need to safely administer drugs and limit unintended side effects has never been greater. Antidote control remains the most direct means to counteract acute side effects of drugs, but, unfortunately, it has been challenging and cost prohibitive to generate antidotes for most therapeutic agents. Here we describe the development of a set of antidote molecules that are capable of counteracting the effects of an entire class of therapeutic agents based upon aptamers. These universal antidotes exploit the fact that, when systemically administered, aptamers are the only free extracellular oligonucleotides found in circulation. We show that protein- and polymer-based molecules that capture oligonucleotides can reverse the activity of several aptamers in vitro and counteract aptamer activity in vivo. The availability of universal antidotes to control the activity of any aptamer suggests that aptamers may be a particularly safe class of therapeutics.},

The different RNA species that are produced in the nucleus are exported through the nuclear pore complexes via mobile export receptors. Small RNAs (such as tRNAs and microRNAs) follow relatively simple export routes by binding directly to export receptors. Large RNAs (such as ribosomal RNAs and mRNAs) assemble into complicated ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles and recruit their exporters via class-specific adaptor proteins. Export of mRNAs is unique as it is extensively coupled to transcription (in yeast) and splicing (in metazoa). Understanding the mechanisms that connect RNP formation with export is a major challenge in the field.},

Although the majority of metazoan genes encode pre-mRNAs that are alternatively spliced, remarkably few splicing regulators are currently known. Here, we used RNA interference to examine the role of >70\% of the Drosophila RNA-binding proteins in regulating alternative splicing. We identified 47 proteins as splicing regulators, 26 of which have not previously been implicated in alternative splicing. Many of the regulators we identified are nonspliceosomal RNA-binding proteins. However, our screen unexpectedly revealed that altering the concentration of certain core components of the spliceosome specifically modulates alternative splicing. These results significantly expand the number of known splicing regulators and reveal an extraordinary richness in the mechanisms that regulate alternative splicing.},

@article{Ghosh2010a,
abstract = {Maintenance of cellular function relies on the expression of genetic information with high fidelity, a process in which RNA molecules form an important link. mRNAs are intermediates that define the proteome, rRNAs and tRNAs are effector molecules that act together to decode mRNA sequence information, and small noncoding RNAs can regulate mRNA half-life and translatability. The steady-state levels of these RNAs occur through transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, of which RNA decay pathways are integral components. RNA decay can initiate from the ends of a transcript or through endonucleolytic cleavage, and numerous factors that catalyze or promote these reactions have been identified and characterized. The rate at which decay occurs depends on RNA sequence or structural elements and usually requires the RNA to be modified in a way that allows recruitment of the decay machinery to the transcript through the binding of accessory factors or small RNAs. The major RNA decay pathways also play important roles in the quality control of gene expression. Acting in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, multiple quality control factors monitor newly synthesized transcripts, or mRNAs undergoing translation, for properties essential to function, including structural integrity or the presence of complete open reading frames. Transcripts targeted by these surveillance mechanisms are rapidly shunted into conventional decay pathways where they are degraded rapidly to ensure that they do not interfere with the normal course of gene expression. Collectively, degradative mechanisms are important determinants of the extent of gene expression and play key roles in maintaining its accuracy.},

abstract = {All immune systems must distinguish self from non-self to repel invaders without inducing autoimmunity. Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci protect bacteria and archaea from invasion by phage and plasmid DNA through a genetic interference pathway1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. CRISPR loci are present in \~{}40\% and \~{}90\% of sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes, respectively10, and evolve rapidly, acquiring new spacer sequences to adapt to highly dynamic viral populations1, 11, 12, 13. Immunity requires a sequence match between the invasive DNA and the spacers that lie between CRISPR repeats1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Each cluster is genetically linked to a subset of the cas (CRISPR-associated) genes14, 15, 16 that collectively encode >40 families of proteins involved in adaptation and interference. CRISPR loci encode small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that contain a full spacer flanked by partial repeat sequences2, 17, 18, 19. CrRNA spacers are thought to identify targets by direct Watson–Crick pairing with invasive ‘protospacer’ DNA2, 3, but how they avoid targeting the spacer DNA within the encoding CRISPR locus itself is unknown. Here we have defined the mechanism of CRISPR self/non-self discrimination. In Staphylococcus epidermidis, target/crRNA mismatches at specific positions outside of the spacer sequence license foreign DNA for interference, whereas extended pairing between crRNA and CRISPR DNA repeats prevents autoimmunity. Hence, this CRISPR system uses the base-pairing potential of crRNAs not only to specify a target, but also to spare the bacterial chromosome from interference. Differential complementarity outside of the spacer sequence is a built-in feature of all CRISPR systems, indicating that this mechanism is a broadly applicable solution to the self/non-self dilemma that confronts all immune pathways.},

ChIRP-seq of three lncRNAs reveal that RNA occupancy sites in the genome are focal, sequence-specific, and numerous. Drosophila roX2 RNA occupies male X-linked gene bodies with increasing tendency toward the 3' end, peaking at CES sites. Human telomerase RNA TERC occupies telomeres and Wnt pathway genes. HOTAIR lncRNA preferentially occupies a GA-rich DNA motif to nucleate broad domains of Polycomb occupancy and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. HOTAIR occupancy occurs independently of EZH2, suggesting the order of RNA guidance of Polycomb occupancy.

The alternative splices of the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel have been the subject of a good deal of experimental functional characterization in the Arthropoda, Chordata, and Nematoda phyla. In this review, we examine a list of splices of the BK channel by manual curation of Unigene clusters mapped to mouse, human, chicken, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes. We find that BK alternative splices do not appear to be conserved across phyla. Despite this lack of conservation, splices occur in both vertebrates and invertebrates at identical regions of the channel at experimentally established domain boundaries. The fact that, across phyla, unique splices occur at experimentally established domain boundaries suggests a prominent role for the convergent evolution of alternative splices that produce functional changes via changes in interdomain communication.},

abstract = {Thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) riboswitches are found in organisms from all three domains of life. Examples in bacteria commonly repress gene expression by terminating transcription or by blocking ribosome binding, whereas most eukaryotic TPP riboswitches are predicted to regulate gene expression by modulating RNA splicing. Given the widespread distribution of eukaryotic TPP riboswitches and the diversity of their locations in precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs), we sought to examine the mechanism of alternative splicing regulation by a fungal TPP riboswitch from Neurospora crassa, which is mostly located in a large intron separating protein-coding exons. Our data reveal that this riboswitch uses a long-distance (∼530-nt separation) base-pairing interaction to regulate alternative splicing. Specifically, a portion of the TPP-binding aptamer can form a base-paired structure with a conserved sequence element ($\alpha$) located near a 5' splice site, which greatly increases use of this 5' splice site and promotes gene expression. Comparative sequence analyses indicate that many fungal species carry a TPP riboswitch with similar intron architecture, and therefore the homologous genes in these fungi are likely to use the same mechanism. Our findings expand the scope of genetic control mechanisms relying on long-range RNA interactions to include riboswitches.},

We have shown before that engineered mice constitutively expressing extra domain A-containing FN (EDA+FN) have a significant decrease of FN levels in plasma and most tissues. We showed that hepatocytes modified to produce EDA+FN have normal extracellular matrix-FN levels but secrete less soluble FN. When we performed a liver-specific EDA-exon deletion in these animals, FN levels were restored both in plasma and tissues. Therefore, an important fraction of tissue FN, approximately an equal amount of that produced by the tissue itself, is actually plasma-derived, suggesting that plasma is an important source of tissue FN. The present results have potential significance for understanding the contributions of plasma FN, and perhaps other plasma proteins, in the modulation of cellular activities and in the formation of the extracellular matrix of tissues.},

abstract = {The Drosophila Dscam1 gene encodes a vast number of cell recognition molecules through alternative splicing. These exhibit isoform-specific homophilic binding and regulate self-avoidance, the tendency of neurites from the same cell to repel one another. Genetic experiments indicate that different cells must express different isoforms. How this is achieved is unknown, as expression of alternative exons in vivo has not been shown. Here, we modified the endogenous Dscam1 locus to generate splicing reporters for all variants of exon 4. We demonstrate that splicing does not occur in a cell-type-specific fashion, that cells sharing the same anatomical location in different individuals express different exon 4 variants, and that the splicing pattern in a given neuron can change over time. We conclude that splicing is probabilistic. This is compatible with a widespread role in neural circuit assembly through self-avoidance and is incompatible with models in which specific isoforms of Dscam1 mediate homophilic recognition between processes of different cells.},

abstract = {In metazoan organisms, pre-mRNA splicing is thought to occur during transcription, and it is postulated that these two processes are functionally coupled via still-unknown mechanisms. Current evidence supports co-transcriptional spliceosomal assembly, but there is little quantitative information on how much splicing is completed during RNA synthesis. Here we isolate nascent chromatin-associated RNA from free, nucleoplasmic RNA already released from the DNA template. Using a quantitative RT-PCR assay, we show that the majority of introns separating constitutive exons are already excised from the human c-Src and fibronectin pre-mRNAs that are still in the process of synthesis, and that these introns are removed in a general 5'-to-3' order. Introns flanking alternative exons in these transcripts are also removed during synthesis, but show differences in excision efficiency between cell lines with different regulatory conditions. Our data suggest that skipping of an exon can induce a lag in splicing compared to intron removal under conditions of exon inclusion. Nevertheless, excision of the long intron encompassing the skipped exon is still completed prior to transcript release into the nucleoplasm. Thus, we demonstrate that the decision to include or skip an alternative exon is made during transcription and not post-transcriptionally.},

abstract = {Exonic splicing silencers (ESSs) are cis-regulatory elements that inhibit the use of adjacent splice sites, often contributing to alternative splicing (AS). To systematically identify ESSs, an in vivo splicing reporter system was developed to screen a library of random decanucleotides. The screen yielded 141 ESS decamers, 133 of which were unique. The silencer activity of over a dozen of these sequences was also confirmed in a heterologous exon/intron context and in a second cell type. Of the unique ESS decamers, most could be clustered into groups to yield seven putative ESS motifs, some resembling known motifs bound by hnRNPs H and A1. Potential roles of ESSs in constitutive splicing were explored using an algorithm, ExonScan, which simulates splicing based on known or putative splicing-related motifs. ExonScan and related bioinformatic analyses suggest that these ESS motifs play important roles in suppression of pseudoexons, in splice site definition, and in AS.},

abstract = {Topoisomerases are expressed throughout the developing and adult brain and are mutated in some individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, how topoisomerases are mechanistically connected to ASD is unknown. Here we find that topotecan, a topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitor, dose-dependently reduces the expression of extremely long genes in mouse and human neurons, including nearly all genes that are longer than 200 kilobases. Expression of long genes is also reduced after knockdown of Top1 or Top2b in neurons, highlighting that both enzymes are required for full expression of long genes. By mapping RNA polymerase II density genome-wide in neurons, we found that this length-dependent effect on gene expression was due to impaired transcription elongation. Interestingly, many high-confidence ASD candidate genes are exceptionally long and were reduced in expression after TOP1 inhibition. Our findings suggest that chemicals and genetic mutations that impair topoisomerases could commonly contribute to ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.},

At the mRNA-specific level, these mechanisms also provide numerous novel targets for small molecule drugs capable of enhancing or inhibiting the accumulation of specific proteins. Here, we describe two drug screening technologies that target the post-transcriptional regulation of specific mRNAs with specific small molecules. In one case the GEMS technology utilizes mRNA-specific 5'- and 3'-UTR pairs to identify compounds that reduce protein production as a consequence of the UTRs. The second example utilizes nonsense-containing mRNAs to identify compounds capable of promoting therapeutic nonsense suppression. Both programs have yielded drug candidates that are presently in clinical testing for human diseases with high unmet clinical needs, thus illustrating the therapeutic potential of targeting post-transcriptional control.},

abstract = {Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes regulate the tissue-specific RNA processing and transport that increases the coding capacity of our genome and the ability to respond quickly and precisely to the diverse set of signals. This review focuses on three proteins that are part of RNP complexes in most cells of our body: TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), the survival motor neuron protein (SMN), and fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP). In particular, the review asks the question why these ubiquitous proteins are primarily associated with defects in specific regions of the central nervous system? To understand this question, it is important to understand the role of genetic and cellular environment in causing the defect in the protein, as well as how the defective protein leads to misregulation of specific target RNAs. Two approaches for comprehensive analysis of defective RNA-protein interactions are presented. The first approach defines the RNA code or the collection of proteins that bind to a certain cis-acting RNA site in order to lead to a predictable outcome. The second approach defines the RNA map or the summary of positions on target RNAs where binding of a particular RNA-binding protein leads to a predictable outcome. As we learn more about the RNA codes and maps that guide the action of the dynamic RNP world in our brain, possibilities for new treatments of neurologic diseases are bound to emerge.},

abstract = {Neurons are characterized by extremely long axons. This exceptional cell shape is likely to depend on multiple factors including interactions between the cytoskeleton and membrane proteins. In many cell types, members of the protein 4.1 family play an important role in tethering the cortical actin-spectrin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. Protein 4.1B is localized in myelinated axons, enriched in paranodal and juxtaparanodal regions, and also all along the internodes, but not at nodes of Ranvier where are localized the voltage-dependent sodium channels responsible for action potential propagation. To shed light on the role of protein 4.1B in the general organization of myelinated peripheral axons, we studied 4.1B knockout mice. These mice displayed a mildly impaired gait and motility. Whereas nodes were unaffected, the distribution of Caspr/paranodin, which anchors 4.1B to the membrane, was disorganized in paranodal regions and its levels were decreased. In juxtaparanodes, the enrichment of Caspr2, which also interacts with 4.1B, and of the associated TAG-1 and Kv1.1, was absent in mutant mice, whereas their levels were unaltered. Ultrastructural abnormalities were observed both at paranodes and juxtaparanodes. Axon calibers were slightly diminished in phrenic nerves and preterminal motor axons were dysmorphic in skeletal muscle. $\beta$II spectrin enrichment was decreased along the axolemma. Electrophysiological recordings at 3 post-natal weeks showed the occurrence of spontaneous and evoked repetitive activity indicating neuronal hyperexcitability, without change in conduction velocity. Thus, our results show that in myelinated axons 4.1B contributes to the stabilization of membrane proteins at paranodes, to the clustering of juxtaparanodal proteins, and to the regulation of the internodal axon caliber.},

@article{Schoenmakers2009,
abstract = {During meiotic prophase in male mammals, the heterologous X and Y chromosomes remain largely unsynapsed, and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) leads to formation of the transcriptionally silenced XY body. In birds, the heterogametic sex is female, carrying Z and W chromosomes (ZW), whereas males have the homogametic ZZ constitution. During chicken oogenesis, the heterologous ZW pair reaches a state of complete heterologous synapsis, and this might enable maintenance of transcription of Z- and W chromosomal genes during meiotic prophase. Herein, we show that the ZW pair is transiently silenced, from early pachytene to early diplotene using immunocytochemistry and gene expression analyses. We propose that ZW inactivation is most likely achieved via spreading of heterochromatin from the W on the Z chromosome. Also, persistent meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) may contribute to silencing of Z. Surprisingly, gammaH2AX, a marker of DSBs, and also the earliest histone modification that is associated with XY body formation in mammalian and marsupial spermatocytes, does not cover the ZW during the synapsed stage. However, when the ZW pair starts to desynapse, a second wave of gammaH2AX accumulates on the unsynapsed regions of Z, which also show a reappearance of the DSB repair protein RAD51. This indicates that repair of meiotic DSBs on the heterologous part of Z is postponed until late pachytene/diplotene, possibly to avoid recombination with regions on the heterologously synapsed W chromosome. Two days after entering diplotene, the Z looses gammaH2AX and shows reactivation. This is the first report of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation in a species with female heterogamety, providing evidence that this mechanism is not specific to spermatogenesis. It also indicates the presence of an evolutionary force that drives meiotic sex chromosome inactivation independent of the final achievement of synapsis.},

abstract = {During the past approximately 20 years, studies on alternative splicing (AS) have largely been directed at the identification and characterization of factors and mecha nisms responsible for the control of splice site selection, using model substrates and on a case by case basis. These studies have provided a wealth of information on the factors and interactions that control formation of the spliceosome. However, relatively little is known about the global regulatory properties of AS. Important questions that need to be addressed are: which exons are alternatively spliced and under which cellular contexts, what are the functional roles of AS events in different cellular contexts, and how are AS events controlled and coordinated with each other and with other levels of gene regulation to achieve cell- and development-specific functions. During the past several years, new technologies and experimental strategies have provided insight into these questions. For example, custom microarrays and data analysis tools are playing a prominent role in the discovery and analysis of splicing regulation. Moreover, several non-microarray-based technologies are emerging that will likely further fuel progress in this area. This review focuses on recent advances made in the development and application of high-throughput methods to study AS.},

@article{Tripathi2010,
abstract = {<p>Summary<br/>Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNA is utilized by higher eukaryotes to achieve increased transcriptome and proteomic complexity. The serine/arginine (SR) splicing factors regulate tissue- or cell-type-specific AS in a concentration- and phosphorylation-dependent manner. However, the mechanisms that modulate the cellular levels of active SR proteins remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we provide evidence for a role for the long nuclear-retained regulatory RNA (nrRNA), MALAT1 in AS regulation. MALAT1 interacts with SR proteins and influences the distribution of these and other splicing factors in nuclear speckle domains. Depletion of MALAT1 or overexpression of an SR protein changes the AS of a similar set of endogenous pre-mRNAs. Furthermore, MALAT1 regulates cellular levels of phosphorylated forms of SR proteins. Taken together, our results suggest that MALAT1 regulates AS by modulating the levels of active SR proteins. Our results further highlight the role for an nrRNA in the regulation of gene expression.</p>},

abstract = {Recent evidence of abundant transcript variation (e.g., alternative splicing, alternative initiation, alternative polyadenylation) in complex genomes indicates that cataloging the complete set of transcripts from an organism is an important project. One challenge is the fact that most high-throughput experimental methods for characterizing transcripts (such as EST sequencing) give highly detailed information about short fragments of transcripts or protein products, instead of a complete characterization of a full-length form. We analyze this "multiassembly problem"-reconstructing the most likely set of full-length isoform sequences from a mixture of EST fragment data-and present a graph-based algorithm for solving it. In a variety of tests, we demonstrate that this algorithm deals appropriately with coupling of distinct alternative splicing events, increasing fragmentation of the input data and different types of transcript variation (such as alternative splicing, initiation, polyadenylation, and intron retention). To test the method's performance on pure fragment (EST) data, we removed all mRNA sequences, and found it produced no errors in 40 cases tested. Using this algorithm, we have constructed an Alternatively Spliced Proteins database (ASP) from analysis of human expressed and genomic sequences, consisting of 13,384 protein isoforms of 4422 genes, yielding an average of 3.0 protein isoforms per gene.},

Among them, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci together with cas (CRISPR-associated) genes form the CRISPR/Cas immune system, which involves partially palindromic repeats separated by short stretches of DNA called spacers, acquired from extrachromosomal elements. It was recently demonstrated that these variable loci can incorporate spacers from infecting bacteriophages and then provide immunity against subsequent bacteriophage infections in a sequence-specific manner. Here we show that the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR1/Cas system can also naturally acquire spacers from a self-replicating plasmid containing an antibiotic-resistance gene, leading to plasmid loss. Acquired spacers that match antibiotic-resistance genes provide a novel means to naturally select bacteria that cannot uptake and disseminate such genes. We also provide in vivo evidence that the CRISPR1/Cas system specifically cleaves plasmid and bacteriophage double-stranded DNA within the proto-spacer, at specific sites. Our data show that the CRISPR/Cas immune system is remarkably adapted to cleave invading DNA rapidly and has the potential for exploitation to generate safer microbial strains.},

abstract = {Summary
piRNAs and Piwi proteins have been implicated in transposon control and are linked to transposon methylation in mammals. Here we examined the construction of the piRNA system in the restricted developmental window in which methylation patterns are set during mammalian embryogenesis. We find robust expression of two Piwi family proteins, MIWI2 and MILI. Their associated piRNA profiles reveal differences from Drosophila wherein large piRNA clusters act as master regulators of silencing. Instead, in mammals, dispersed transposon copies initiate the pathway, producing primary piRNAs, which predominantly join MILI in the cytoplasm. MIWI2, whose nuclear localization and association with piRNAs depend upon MILI, is enriched for secondary piRNAs antisense to the elements that it controls. The Piwi pathway lies upstream of known mediators of DNA methylation, since piRNAs are still produced in dnmt3L mutants, which fail to methylate transposons. This implicates piRNAs as specificity determinants of DNA methylation in germ cells.},

abstract = {The Spo11 protein initiates meiotic recombination by generating DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and is required for meiotic synapsis in S. cerevisiae. Surprisingly, Spo11 homologs are dispensable for synapsis in C. elegans and Drosophila yet required for meiotic recombination. Disruption of mouse Spo11 results in infertility. Spermatocytes arrest prior to pachytene with little or no synapsis and undergo apoptosis. We did not detect Rad51/Dmc1 foci in meiotic chromosome spreads, indicating DSBs are not formed. Cisplatin-induced DSBs restored Rad51/Dmc1 foci and promoted synapsis. Spo11 localizes to discrete foci during leptotene and to homologously synapsed chromosomes. Other mouse mutants that arrest during meiotic prophase (Atm -/-, Dmc1 -/-, mei1, and Morc(-/-)) showed altered Spo11 protein localization and expression. We speculate that there is an additional role for Spo11, after it generates DSBs, in synapsis.},

@article{Reuter2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: To understand an RNA sequence's mechanism of action, the structure must be known. Furthermore, target RNA structure is an important consideration in the design of small interfering RNAs and antisense DNA oligonucleotides. RNA secondary structure prediction, using thermodynamics, can be used to develop hypotheses about the structure of an RNA sequence.

RESULTS: RNAstructure is a software package for RNA secondary structure prediction and analysis. It uses thermodynamics and utilizes the most recent set of nearest neighbor parameters from the Turner group. It includes methods for secondary structure prediction (using several algorithms), prediction of base pair probabilities, bimolecular structure prediction, and prediction of a structure common to two sequences. This contribution describes new extensions to the package, including a library of C++ classes for incorporation into other programs, a user-friendly graphical user interface written in JAVA, and new Unix-style text interfaces. The original graphical user interface for Microsoft Windows is still maintained.

CONCLUSION: The extensions to RNAstructure serve to make RNA secondary structure prediction user-friendly. The package is available for download from the Mathews lab homepage at http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructure.html.},

abstract = {Small RNAs bound to Argonaute proteins recognize partially or fully complementary nucleic acid targets in diverse gene-silencing processes. A subgroup of the Argonaute proteins--known as the 'Piwi family'--is required for germ- and stem-cell development in invertebrates, and two Piwi members--MILI and MIWI--are essential for spermatogenesis in mouse. Here we describe a new class of small RNAs that bind to MILI in mouse male germ cells, where they accumulate at the onset of meiosis. The sequences of the over 1,000 identified unique molecules share a strong preference for a 5' uridine, but otherwise cannot be readily classified into sequence families. Genomic mapping of these small RNAs reveals a limited number of clusters, suggesting that these RNAs are processed from long primary transcripts. The small RNAs are 26-31 nucleotides (nt) in length--clearly distinct from the 21-23 nt of microRNAs (miRNAs) or short interfering RNAs (siRNAs)--and we refer to them as 'Piwi-interacting RNAs' or piRNAs. Orthologous human chromosomal regions also give rise to small RNAs with the characteristics of piRNAs, but the cloned sequences are distinct. The identification of this new class of small RNAs provides an important starting point to determine the molecular function of Piwi proteins in mammalian spermatogenesis.},

abstract = {The 30S ribosomal subunit has two primary functions in protein synthesis. It discriminates against aminoacyl transfer RNAs that do not match the codon of messenger RNA, thereby ensuring accuracy in translation of the genetic message in a process called decoding. Also, it works with the 50S subunit to move the tRNAs and associated mRNA by precisely one codon, in a process called translocation. Here we describe the functional implications of the high-resolution 30S crystal structure presented in the accompanying paper, and infer details of the interactions between the 30S subunit and its tRNA and mRNA ligands. We also describe the crystal structure of the 30S subunit complexed with the antibiotics paromomycin, streptomycin and spectinomycin, which interfere with decoding and translocation. This work reveals the structural basis for the action of these antibiotics, and leads to a model for the role of the universally conserved 16S RNA residues A1492 and A1493 in the decoding process.},

Here we report genome-wide analysis of alternative splicing patterns regulated by four Drosophila homologs of the mammalian hnRNP A/B family (hrp36, hrp38, hrp40, and hrp48). Analysis of the global RNA-binding distributions of each protein revealed both small and extensively bound regions on target transcripts. A significant subset of RNAs were bound and regulated by more than one hnRNP protein, revealing a combinatorial network of interactions. In vitro RNA-binding site selection experiments (SELEX) identified distinct binding motif specificities for each protein, which were overrepresented in their respective regulated and bound transcripts. These results indicate that individual heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins have specific affinities for overlapping, but distinct, populations of target pre-mRNAs controlling their patterns of RNA processing.},

abstract = {Gypsy displays striking similarities to vertebrate retroviruses, including the presence of a yet uncharacterized additional open reading frame (ORF3) and the recent evidence for infectivity. It is mobilized with high frequency in the germline of the progeny of females homozygous for the flamenco permissive mutation. We report the characterization of a gypsy subgenomic ORF3 RNA encoding typical retroviral envelope proteins. In females, env expression is strongly repressed by one copy of the non-permissive allele of flamenco. A less dramatic reduction in the accumulation of other transcripts and retrotranscripts is also observed. These effects correlate well with the inhibition of gypsy transposition in the progeny of these females, and are therefore likely to be responsible for this phenomenon. The effects of flamenco on gypsy expression are apparently restricted to the somatic follicle cells that surround the maternal germline. Moreover, permissive follicle cells display a typically polarized distribution of gypsy RNAs and envelope proteins, both being mainly accumulated at the apical pole, close to the oocyte. We propose a model suggesting that gypsy germinal transposition might occur only in individuals that have maternally inherited enveloped gypsy particles due to infection of the maternal germline by the soma.},

However, the factors and mechanisms governing nervous system-specific alternative splicing are not well understood. Through a genome-wide computational and expression profiling strategy, we have identified a tissue- and vertebrate-restricted Ser/Arg (SR) repeat splicing factor, the neural-specific SR-related protein of 100 kDa (nSR100). We show that nSR100 regulates an extensive network of brain-specific alternative exons enriched in genes that function in neural cell differentiation. nSR100 acts by increasing the levels of the neural/brain-enriched polypyrimidine tract binding protein and by interacting with its target transcripts. Disruption of nSR100 prevents neural cell differentiation in cell culture and in the developing zebrafish. Our results thus reveal a critical neural-specific alternative splicing regulator, the evolution of which has contributed to increased complexity in the vertebrate nervous system.},

High-throughput enabling technologies, particularly large-scale sequencing and splicing-sensitive microarrays, are providing unprecedented opportunities to address key questions in this field. The picture emerging from these pioneering studies is that alternative splicing affects most human genes and a significant fraction of the genes in other multicellular organisms, with the potential to greatly influence the evolution of complex genomes. A combinatorial code of regulatory signals and factors can deploy physiologically coherent programs of alternative splicing that are distinct from those regulated at other steps of gene expression. Pre-mRNA splicing and its regulation play important roles in human pathologies, and genome-wide analyses in this area are paving the way for improved diagnostic tools and for the identification of novel and more specific pharmaceutical targets.},

abstract = {Many proteins are composed of protein domains, functional units of common descent. Multidomain forms are common in all eukaryotes making up more than half of the proteome and the evolution of novel domain architecture has been accelerated in metazoans. It is also becoming increasingly clear that alternative splicing is prevalent among vertebrates. Given that protein domains are defined as structurally, functionally and evolutionarily distinct units, one may speculate that some alternative splicing events may lead to clean excisions of protein domains, thus generating a number of different domain architectures from one gene template. However, recent findings indicate that smaller alternative splicing events, in particular in disordered regions, might be more prominent than domain architectural changes. The problem of identifying protein isoforms is, however, still not resolved. Clearly, many splice forms identified through detection of mRNA sequences appear to produce 'nonfunctional' proteins, such as proteins with missing internal secondary structure elements. Here, we review the state of the art methods for identification of functional isoforms and present a summary of what is known, thus far, about alternative splicing with regard to protein domain architectures.},

With these studies in mind, it would seem that a majority of the splice products are unlikely to produce functional proteins. It has been assumed that these transcripts are instead targeted for nonsense mediated decay (NMD); however, to the best of our knowledge this has not been explicitly proven, but it is quite clear that these transcripts are nonfunctional. Obviously this causes many problems when analyzing alternative splicing and differences in domain architectures since it becomes crucial to identify the transcripts that are associated with protein isoforms

Whereas small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) derive from both the sense and antisense strands of their double-stranded RNA precursors, rasiRNAs arise mainly from the antisense strand. rasiRNA production appears not to require Dicer-1, which makes microRNAs (miRNAs), or Dicer-2, which makes siRNAs, and rasiRNAs lack the 2′,3′ hydroxy termini characteristic of animal siRNA and miRNA. Unlike siRNAs and miRNAs, rasiRNAs function through the Piwi, rather than the Ago, Argonaute protein subfamily. Our data suggest that rasiRNAs protect the fly germline through a silencing mechanism distinct from both the miRNA and RNA interference pathways.},

abstract = {RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and thus has motivated extensive computational and experimental efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in vivo. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with unpaired adenine and cytosine residues, followed by deep sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most thermodynamically favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete role in determining mRNA structure in vivo.},

Although mammalian genomes contain only three neurexin genes, thousands of neurexin isoforms may be expressed through the use of two alternative promoters and alternative splicing at up to five different positions in the pre-mRNA. To begin understanding how the expression of the neurexin genes is regulated, we have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of all three human neurexin genes: NRXN1, NRXN2, and NRXN3. Unexpectedly, two of these, NRXN1 ( approximately 1.1 Mb) and NRXN3 ( approximately 1.7 Mb), are among the largest known human genes. In addition, we have identified several conserved intronic sequence elements that may participate in the regulation of alternative splicing. The sequences of these genes provide insight into the mechanisms used to generate the diversity of neurexin protein isoforms and raise several interesting questions regarding the expression mechanism of large genes.},

abstract = {Oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H protection assays are powerful means to analyze protein binding domains in ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs). In such an assay, the RNA component of a RNP and, in an essential control reaction, the corresponding deproteinized RNA are targeted with an antisense DNA oligonucleotide and RNase H. If the oligonucleotide is able to anneal to the complementary sequence of the RNA, RNase H will cleave the RNA within the double-stranded DNA/RNA region. However, protein binding to a specific RNA sequence may prevent hybridization of the DNA oligonucleotide, thereby protecting the RNA molecule from endonucleolytic cleavage. An RNase H protection analysis can usually be carried out with crude cell extract and does not require further RNP purification. On the other hand, purified RNP fractions are preferable when a crude extract contains RNase activity or a heterogenous RNP population of a specific RNA. The cleavage pattern of RNase H digestion can be analyzed by Northern blotting or primer-extension assays. In addition, the investigation of RNP fragments, for example, by native gel electrophoresis, may reveal important structural information about a RNP. In this article, we describe procedures for RNP and RNA preparation, the oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H protection assay, and methods for the analysis of RNA and RNP cleavage products. As an example, we show oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H protection of the Trypanosoma brucei U1 small nuclear RNP.},

The system resolves individual splicing events and elucidates transcript variants via a pipeline that combines aspects such as bioinformatic analysis, high-throughput transcript variant amplification, and high-resolution capillary electrophoresis. For the 14 369 human genes known to have transcript variants, minimal primer sets were designed to amplify all transcript variants and examine all splicing events; these have been archived in the ASprimerDB database, which is newly described herein. A high-throughput thermocycler, dubbed GenTank, was developed to simultaneously perform thousands of PCR amplifications. Following the resolution of the various amplicons by capillary gel electrophoresis, two new computer programs, AmpliconViewer and VariantAssembler, may be used to analyze the splicing events, assemble the consecutive exons embodied by the PCR amplicons, and distinguish expressed versus putative transcript variants. This novel system not only facilitates the validation of putative transcript variants and the detection of novel transcript variants, it also semi-quantitatively measures the transcript variant expression levels of each gene. To demonstrate the system’s capability, we used it to resolve transcript variants yielded by single and multiple splicing events, and to decipher the exon connectivity of long transcripts.},

Combining tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we identified a number of mRNA processing factors that bind to a soluble recombinant Mediator subunit, MED23, but not to several other Mediator components. One of these factors, hnRNP L, specifically interacts with MED23 in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, Mediator partially colocalizes with hnRNP L and the splicing machinery in the cell. Functionally, MED23 regulates a subset of hnRNP L-targeted alternative splicing (AS) and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) events, as shown by minigene reporters and exon array analysis. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that MED23 can regulate hnRNP L occupancy at their coregulated genes. Taken together, these results demonstrate a crosstalk between Mediator and the splicing machinery, providing a molecular basis for coupling mRNA processing to transcription.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is a powerful mechanism affording extensive proteomic and regulatory diversity from a limited repertoire of genes. However, the extent to which alternative splicing has contributed to the evolution of primate species-specific characteristics has not been assessed previously. Using comparative genomics and quantitative microarray profiling, we performed the first global analysis of alternative splicing differences between humans and chimpanzees. Surprisingly, 6\%-8\% of profiled orthologous exons display pronounced splicing level differences in the corresponding tissues from the two species. Little overlap is observed between the genes associated with alternative splicing differences and the genes that display steady-state transcript level differences, indicating that these layers of regulation have evolved rapidly to affect distinct subsets of genes in humans and chimpanzees. The alternative splicing differences we detected are predicted to affect diverse functions including gene expression, signal transduction, cell death, immune defense, and susceptibility to diseases. Differences in expression at the protein level of the major splice variant of Glutathione S-transferase omega-2 (GSTO2), which functions in the protection against oxidative stress and is associated with human aging-related diseases, suggests that this enzyme is less active in human cells compared with chimpanzee cells. The results of this study thus support an important role for alternative splicing in establishing differences between humans and chimpanzees.},

Whole-genome approaches (1) and human expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing (2) have started to exert profound influence on biology and medicine. The need for robust, high-throughput methods to replace the elegant Sanger method, described more than 20 years ago (3), has led to the development of several new principles, such as array methods based on sequencing by hybridization (4). New applications, such as population-based biodiversity projects and brute-force genotyping using single-nucleotide polymorphism, make such efforts even more urgent, in particular, for simple and robust methods for sequencing short ``tags'' (1 to 20 bases) such as ESTs or biallelic markers and methods suitable for routine diagnostic applications.},

abstract = {The Michaelis-Menten equation provides a hundred-year-old prediction by which any increase in the rate of substrate unbinding will decrease the rate of enzymatic turnover. Surprisingly, this prediction was never tested experimentally nor was it scrutinized using modern theoretical tools. Here we show that unbinding may also speed up enzymatic turnover-turning a spotlight to the fact that its actual role in enzymatic catalysis remains to be determined experimentally. Analytically constructing the unbinding phase space, we identify four distinct categories of unbinding: inhibitory, excitatory, superexcitatory, and restorative. A transition in which the effect of unbinding changes from inhibitory to excitatory as substrate concentrations increase, and an overlooked tradeoff between the speed and efficiency of enzymatic reactions, are naturally unveiled as a result. The theory presented herein motivates, and allows the interpretation of, groundbreaking experiments in which existing single-molecule manipulation techniques will be adapted for the purpose of measuring enzymatic turnover under a controlled variation of unbinding rates. As we hereby show, these experiments will not only shed first light on the role of unbinding but will also allow one to determine the time distribution required for the completion of the catalytic step in isolation from the rest of the enzymatic turnover cycle.},

Genome-wide analysis of protein-nucleic acid contacts has not yet been performed for most of these proteins, restricting attempts to establish a comprehensive understanding of protein function. UV cross-linking is a method typically used to determine the position of direct interactions between proteins and nucleic acids. We have developed the cross-linking and immunoprecipitation assay, which exploits the covalent protein-nucleic acid cross-linking to stringently purify a specific protein-RNA complex using immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE separation. In this way, the vast majority of non-specific contaminating RNA, which can bind to co-immunoprecipitated proteins or beads, can be removed. Here, we present an improved protocol that performs RNA linker ligation before the SDS-PAGE step, and describe its application to the specific purification and amplification of RNA ligands of Nova in neurons.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing is one of the central mechanisms that regulate eukaryotic gene expression. Here we report a tissue-specific RNA-binding protein, Fox-1, which regulates alternative splicing in vertebrates. Fox-1 bound specifically to a pentanucleotide GCAUG in vitro. In zebrafish and mouse, fox-1 is expressed in heart and skeletal muscles. As candidates for muscle-specific targets of Fox-1, we considered two genes, the human mitochondrial ATP synthase gamma-subunit gene (F1gamma) and the rat alpha-actinin gene, because their primary transcripts contain several copies of GCAUG. In transfection experiments, Fox-1 induced muscle-specific exon skipping of the F1gamma gene via binding to GCAUG sequences upstream of the regulated exon. Fox-1 also regulated mutually exclusive splicing of the alpha-actinin gene, antagonizing the repressive effect of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB). It has been reported that GCAUG is essential for the alternative splicing regulation of several genes including fibronectin. We found that Fox-1 promoted inclusion of the fibronectin EIIIB exon. Thus, we conclude that Fox-1 plays key roles in both positive and negative regulation of tissue-specific splicing via GCAUG.},

abstract = {Cadherins and the immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins give rise to a multitude of surface receptors, which function as diverse cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) or signal-transducing receptors. These functions are often interdependent, and rely on a high degree of specificity in homophilic binding as well as heterophilic interactions. The Drosophila receptor Dscam is an exceptional example of homophilic binding specificity involved in a number of important biological processes, such as neural wiring and innate immunity. Combinatorial use of alternatively spliced Ig-domains enables the generation of an estimated 18,000 isoform-specific homophilic receptor pairs. Although isoform diversity of Dscam is unique to arthropods, recent genetic analysis of vertebrate DSCAM (Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule) genes has revealed an intriguing conservation of molecular functions underlying neural wiring. This review covers the multiple functions of Dscam across different species highlighting its remarkable versatility as well as its conserved basic functions in neural development. We discuss how an unprecedented expansion of complex alternative splicing has been uniquely employed by arthropods to generate diverse surface receptors, important for cell-cell communication, molecular self-recognition in neurons, and innate immune defenses. We end with a speculative hypothesis reconciling the striking differences in Dscam and DSCAM gene structures with their conserved functions in molecular recognition underlying neural circuit formation.},

All RNA interference pathways use small single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) molecules that guide proteins of the Argonaute (Ago) family to complementary ssRNA targets: RNA-guided RNA interference. The role of prokaryotic Ago variants has remained elusive, although bioinformatics analysis has suggested their involvement in host defence. Here we demonstrate that Ago of the bacterium Thermus thermophilus (TtAgo) acts as a barrier for the uptake and propagation of foreign DNA. In vivo, TtAgo is loaded with 5'-phosphorylated DNA guides, 13-25 nucleotides in length, that are mostly plasmid derived and have a strong bias for a 5'-end deoxycytidine. These small interfering DNAs guide TtAgo to cleave complementary DNA strands. Hence, despite structural homology to its eukaryotic counterparts, TtAgo functions in host defence by DNA-guided DNA interference.},

Here we present NorahDesk, the first unbiased and universally applicable method for small ncRNAs detection from RNA-Seq data. NorahDesk utilizes the coverage-distribution of small RNA sequence data as well as thermodynamic assessments of secondary structure to reliably predict and annotate ncRNA classes. Using publicly available mouse sequence data from brain, skeletal muscle, testis and ovary, we evaluated our method with an emphasis on the performance for microRNAs (miRNAs) and piwi-interacting small RNA (piRNA). We compared our method with Dario and mirDeep2 and found that NorahDesk produces longer transcripts with higher read coverage.

Despite intensive efforts, our understanding of the functional implications of this dynamically created diversity is still incomplete. Using the available knowledge of interaction modules, particularly within intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), we analysed the occurrences of protein modules within alternative exons. We find that regions removed or included by pre-translational variation are enriched in linear motifs suggesting that the removal or inclusion of exons containing these interaction modules is an important regulatory mechanism. In particular, we observe that PDZ-, PTB-, SH2- and WW-domain binding motifs are more likely to occur within alternative exons. We also determine that regions removed or included by alternative promoter usage are enriched in IDRs suggesting that protein isoform diversity is tightly coupled to the modulation of IDRs. This study, therefore, demonstrates that short linear motifs are key components for establishing protein diversity between splice variants.},

Here, we present Scripture, a method to reconstruct the transcriptome of a mammalian cell using only RNA-Seq reads and the genome sequence. We applied it to mouse embryonic stem cells, neuronal precursor cells and lung fibroblasts to accurately reconstruct the full-length gene structures for most known expressed genes. We identified substantial variation in protein coding genes, including thousands of novel 5′ start sites, 3′ ends and internal coding exons. We then determined the gene structures of more than a thousand large intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) and antisense loci. Our results open the way to direct experimental manipulation of thousands of noncoding RNAs and demonstrate the power of ab initio reconstruction to render a comprehensive picture of mammalian transcriptomes.

abstract = {Gene identification studies, centred on a region of overlapping loss of heterozygosity in breast tumours within band 1p31.1, lead to the characterisation of LPHH1, a novel human 7TM gene. The coding sequence of LPHH1 extends over a 60 kb region and comprises in excess of 28 exons. Alternative splicing occurs minimally at five positions, four of which are within the coding sequence. The fifth region of alternative splicing occurs at the extreme 5' end of the transcript. A clear tissue specific bias in alternative exon selection is observed to some degree at all five positions, including the extreme 5' region, which raises the possibility of multiple and perhaps tissue specific promoters. One such putative promoter region, which appears to be utilised predominantly in breast cancer cells, has been identified. LPHH1 is highly evolutionarily conserved, with the simplest (19 exon) gene product being 95\% identical between human and rat. Comparison of the alternatively spliced exons between three species, where data are available, has so far revealed 100\% identity in the encoded peptide sequences, suggesting conservation of a functional aspect of this splicing. Gene expression has been observed in all tissues and cell lines tested, with the exception of lymphoblastoid and multiple myeloma lines, where there appears to be only a very low level of transcription. LPHH1 also appears to be downregulated in human bone marrow. These data are consistent with a role for the gene products in adhesion-mediated signalling. Analysis of a panel of breast tumour cell lines revealed that a number apparently overexpressed the gene whilst others showed very low levels of transcription. In one case, the overexpression correlated with a low level increase in gene copy number in the tumour line. In addition to differences in the overall levels of expression, LPHH1 mRNAs were alternatively spliced to varying degrees with shifts in the major gene product to truncated or altered forms in some lines. No somatic LPHH1 mutations were detected through sequence analysis of four primary breast tumours that showed loss of the adjacent 1p31.1 marker D1S207.},

abstract = {To explore the scope and significance of alternate promoter usage and its putative inter-relationship to alternative splicing, we searched expression sequence tags for the 5' region of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) genes. Three and five novel first exons were identified in human and mouse ACHE genes, respectively. Reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization validated most of the predicted transcripts, and sequence analyses of the corresponding genomic DNA regions suggest evolutionarily conserved promoters for each of the novel exons identified. Distinct tissue specificity and stress-related expression patterns of these exons predict combinatorial complexity with known 3' alternative AChE mRNA transcripts. Unexpectedly one of the 5' exons encodes an extended N terminus in-frame with the known AChE sequence, extending the increased complexity to the protein level. The resultant membrane variant(s), designated N-AChE, is developmentally regulated in human brain neurons and blood mononuclear cells. Alternative promoter usage combined with alternative splicing may thus lead to stress-dependent combinatorial complexity of AChE mRNA transcripts and their protein products.},

abstract = {Polycomb proteins play essential roles in stem cell renewal and human disease. Recent studies of HOX genes and X inactivation have provided evidence for RNA cofactors in Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Here we develop a RIP-seq method to capture the PRC2 transcriptome and identify a genome-wide pool of >9000 PRC2-interacting RNAs in embryonic stem cells. The transcriptome includes antisense, intergenic, and promoter-associated transcripts, as well as many unannotated RNAs. A large number of transcripts occur within imprinted regions, oncogene and tumor suppressor loci, and stem cell-related bivalent domains. We provide evidence for direct RNA-protein interactions, most likely via the Ezh2 subunit. We also identify Gtl2 RNA as a PRC2 cofactor that directs PRC2 to the reciprocally imprinted Dlk1 coding gene. Thus, Polycomb proteins interact with a genome-wide family of RNAs, some of which may be used as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for human disease.},

abstract = {We recently showed that the mammalian genome encodes >1,000 large intergenic noncoding (linc)RNAs that are clearly conserved across mammals and, thus, functional. Gene expression patterns have implicated these lincRNAs in diverse biological processes, including cell-cycle regulation, immune surveillance, and embryonic stem cell pluripotency. However, the mechanism by which these lincRNAs function is unknown. Here, we expand the catalog of human lincRNAs to ≈3,300 by analyzing chromatin-state maps of various human cell types. Inspired by the observation that the well-characterized lincRNA HOTAIR binds the polycomb repressive complex (PRC)2, we tested whether many lincRNAs are physically associated with PRC2. Remarkably, we observe that ≈20\% of lincRNAs expressed in various cell types are bound by PRC2, and that additional lincRNAs are bound by other chromatin-modifying complexes. Also, we show that siRNA-mediated depletion of certain lincRNAs associated with PRC2 leads to changes in gene expression, and that the up-regulated genes are enriched for those normally silenced by PRC2. We propose a model in which some lincRNAs guide chromatin-modifying complexes to specific genomic loci to regulate gene expression.},

Current approaches for transcript reconstruction from such data often rely on aligning reads to a reference genome, and are thus unsuitable for samples with a partial or missing reference genome. Here we present the Trinity method for de novo assembly of full-length transcripts and evaluate it on samples from fission yeast, mouse and whitefly, whose reference genome is not yet available. By efficiently constructing and analyzing sets of de Bruijn graphs, Trinity fully reconstructs a large fraction of transcripts, including alternatively spliced isoforms and transcripts from recently duplicated genes. Compared with other de novo transcriptome assemblers, Trinity recovers more full-length transcripts across a broad range of expression levels, with a sensitivity similar to methods that rely on genome alignments. Our approach provides a unified solution for transcriptome reconstruction in any sample, especially in the absence of a reference genome.},

abstract = {The enzyme-AMP reaction intermediate of the 102-kDa bovine DNA ligase I was digested with trypsin, and the adenylylated peptide was isolated by chromatography under conditions that maintain the acid-labile phosphoramidate bond. Microsequencing of the peptide showed that it contains an internal trypsin-resistant lysine residue, as expected for the site of adenylylation. Inhibition of DNA ligase I activity by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate also indicated the presence of a reactive lysine residue in the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Comparison of the known primary structures of several other DNA ligases with the adenylylated region of mammalian DNA ligase I allows their active sites to be tentatively assigned by sequence homology. The ATP-dependent DNA ligases of mammalian cells, fission yeast, budding yeast, vaccinia virus, and bacteriophages T3, T4, and T7 contain the active site motif Lys-Tyr/Ala-Asp-Gly-(Xaa)-Arg, with the reactive lysine residue flanked by hydrophobic amino acids. The distance between the postulated adenylylation site and the carboxyl terminus of the polypeptide is very similar in these ATP-dependent DNA ligases, whereas the size of the amino-terminal region is highly variable.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is a powerful and versatile regulatory mechanism that can effect quantitative control of gene expression and functional diversification of proteins. It contributes to major developmental decisions and also to fine tuning of gene function. Genetic and biochemical approaches have identified cis-acting regulatory elements and trans-acting factors that control alternative splicing of specific pre-mRNAs. Both approaches are contributing to an understanding of their mode of action. Some alternative splicing decisions are controlled by specific factors whose expression is highly restricted during development, but others may be controlled by more modest variations in the levels of general factors acting cooperatively or antagonistically. Certain factors play active roles in both constitutive splicing and regulation of alternative splicing. Cooperative and antagonistic effects integrated at regulatory elements are likely to be important for specificity and for finely tuned differences in cell-type-specific alternative splicing patterns.},

@article{Kumar1998,
abstract = {There is ample evidence that cells of higher eukaryotes express double-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNAs) either naturally or as the result of viral infection or aberrant, bidirectional transcriptional readthrough. These duplex molecules can exist in either the cytoplasmic or nuclear compartments. Cells have evolved distinct ways of responding to dsRNAs, depending on the nature and location of the duplexes. Since dsRNA molecules are not thought to exist naturally within the cytoplasm, dsRNA in this compartment is most often associated with viral infections. Cells have evolved defensive strategies against such molecules, primarily involving the interferon response pathway. Nuclear dsRNA, however, does not induce interferons and may play an important posttranscriptional regulatory role. Nuclear dsRNA appears to be the substrate for enzymes which deaminate adenosine residues to inosine residues within the polynucleotide structure, resulting in partial or full unwinding. Extensively modified RNAs are either rapidly degraded or retained within the nucleus, whereas transcripts with few modifications may be transported to the cytoplasm, where they serve to produce altered proteins. This review summarizes our current knowledge about the function and fate of dsRNA in cells of higher eukaryotes and its potential manipulation as a research and therapeutic tool.},

abstract = {DNA damage induces apoptosis and many apoptotic genes are regulated via alternative splicing (AS), but little is known about the control mechanisms. Here we show that ultraviolet irradiation (UV) affects cotranscriptional AS in a p53-independent way, through the hyperphosphorylation of RNA polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) and a subsequent inhibition of transcriptional elongation, estimated in vivo and in real time. Phosphomimetic CTD mutants not only display lower elongation but also duplicate the UV effect on AS. Consistently, nonphosphorylatable mutants prevent the UV effect. Apoptosis promoted by UV in cells lacking p53 is prevented when the change in AS of the apoptotic gene bcl-x is reverted, confirming the relevance of this mechanism. Splicing-sensitive microarrays revealed a significant overlap of the subsets of genes that have changed AS with UV and those that have reduced expression, suggesting that transcriptional coupling to AS is a key feature of the DNA-damage response.},

abstract = {Vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) are obligate blood feeders that have evolved specialized systems to suit their sanguinary lifestyle. Chief among such adaptations is the ability to detect infrared radiation as a means of locating hotspots on warm-blooded prey. Among vertebrates, only vampire bats, boas, pythons and pit vipers are capable of detecting infrared radiation. In each case, infrared signals are detected by trigeminal nerve fibres that innervate specialized pit organs on the animal's face. Thus, vampire bats and snakes have taken thermosensation to the extreme by developing specialized systems for detecting infrared radiation. As such, these creatures provide a window into the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying evolutionary tuning of thermoreceptors in a species-specific or cell-type-specific manner. Previously, we have shown that snakes co-opt a non-heat-sensitive channel, vertebrate TRPA1 (transient receptor potential cation channel A1), to produce an infrared detector. Here we show that vampire bats tune a channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30 °C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. This reflects a unique organization of the bat Trpv1 gene that we show to be characteristic of Laurasiatheria mammals (cows, dogs and moles), supporting a close phylogenetic relationship with bats. These findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism for physiological tuning of thermosensory nerve fibres.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND: High throughput DNA sequencing technology has enabled quantification of all the RNAs in a cell or tissue, a method widely known as RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). However, non-coding RNAs such as rRNA are highly abundant and can consume >70\% of sequencing reads. A common approach is to extract only polyadenylated mRNA; however, such approaches are blind to RNAs with short or no poly(A) tails, leading to an incomplete view of the transcriptome. Another challenge of preparing RNA-Seq libraries is to preserve the strand information of the RNAs. DESIGN: Here, we describe a procedure for preparing RNA-Seq libraries from 1 to 4 $\mu$g total RNA without poly(A) selection. Our method combines the deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP)/uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) strategy to achieve strand specificity with AMPure XP magnetic beads to perform size selection. Together, these steps eliminate gel purification, allowing a library to be made in less than two days. We barcode each library during the final PCR amplification step, allowing several samples to be sequenced in a single lane without sacrificing read length. Libraries prepared using this protocol are compatible with Illumina GAII, GAIIx and HiSeq 2000 platforms. DISCUSSION: The RNA-Seq protocol described here yields strand-specific transcriptome libraries without poly(A) selection, which provide approximately 90\% mappable sequences. Typically, more than 85\% of mapped reads correspond to protein-coding genes and only 6\% derive from non-coding RNAs. The protocol has been used to measure RNA transcript identity and abundance in tissues from flies, mice, rats, chickens, and frogs, demonstrating its general applicability.},

abstract = {Viral oncogenes are responsible for oncogenesis resulting from persistent virus infection. Although different human tumor viruses express different viral oncogenes and induce different tumors, their oncoproteins often target similar sets of cellular tumor suppressors or signal pathways to immortalize and/or transform infected cells. Expression of the viral E6 and E7 oncogenes in papillomavirus, E1A and E1B oncogenes in adenovirus, large T and small t antigen in polyomavirus, and Tax oncogene in HTLV-1 are regulated by alternative RNA splicing. However, this regulation is only partially understood. DNA tumor viruses also encode noncoding RNAs, including viral microRNAs, that disturb normal cell functions. Among the determined viral microRNA precursors, EBV encodes 25 from two major clusters (BART and BHRF1), KSHV encodes 12 from a latent region, human polyomavirus MCV produce only one microRNA from the late region antisense to early transcripts, but HPVs appears to produce no viral microRNAs.},

abstract = {Antisense-mediated modulation of splicing is one of the few fields where antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) have been able to live up to their expectations. In this approach, AONs are implemented to restore cryptic splicing, to change levels of alternatively spliced genes, or, in case of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), to skip an exon in order to restore a disrupted reading frame. The latter allows the generation of internally deleted, but largely functional, dystrophin proteins and would convert a severe DMD into a milder Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype. In fact, exon skipping is currently one of the most promising therapeutic tools for DMD, and a successful first-in-man trial has recently been completed. In this review the applicability of exon skipping for DMD and other diseases is described. For DMD AONs have been designed for numerous exons, which has given us insight into their mode of action, splicing in general, and splicing of the  gene in particular. In addition, retrospective analysis resulted in guidelines for AON design for  and most likely other genes as well. This knowledge allows us to optimize therapeutic exon skipping, but also opens up a range of other applications for the exon skipping approach.},

abstract = {The human genome encodes the blueprint of life, but the function of the vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

abstract = {Gene and intron prediction are essential for accurate inferences about genome evolution. Recently, two genome-wide studies searched for recent intron gains in humans, reaching very different conclusions: either of a complete absence of intron gain since early mammalian evolution, or of creation of numerous introns by genomic duplication in repetitive regions. We discuss one possible explanation: the underappreciated phenomenon of "template switching", by which reverse transcriptase may create artifactual splicing-like events in the preparation of cDNA/EST libraries, may cause complications in searches for newly gained introns in repetitive regions. We report large numbers of apparent template switching in transcript sequences from the intron-poor protists Trichomonas vaginalis and Giardia lamblia.

However, mammalian Piwi proteins, MIWI and MILI, partner with Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that are depleted of repeat sequences, which raises questions about a role for mammalian Piwi's in transposon control. A search for murine small RNAs that might program Piwi proteins for transposon suppression revealed developmentally regulated piRNA loci, some of which resemble transposon master control loci of Drosophila. We also find evidence of an adaptive amplification loop in which MILI catalyzes the formation of piRNA 5' ends. Mili mutants derepress LINE-1 (L1) and intracisternal A particle and lose DNA methylation of L1 elements, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved role for PIWI proteins in transposon suppression.},

abstract = {Large noncoding RNAs are emerging as an important component in cellular regulation. Considerable evidence indicates that these transcripts act directly as functional RNAs rather than through an encoded protein product. However, a recent study of ribosome occupancy reported that many large intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) are bound by ribosomes, raising the possibility that they are translated into proteins. Here, we show that classical noncoding RNAs and 5' UTRs show the same ribosome occupancy as lincRNAs, demonstrating that ribosome occupancy alone is not sufficient to classify transcripts as coding or noncoding. Instead, we define a metric based on the known property of translation whereby translating ribosomes are released upon encountering a bona fide stop codon. We show that this metric accurately discriminates between protein-coding transcripts and all classes of known noncoding transcripts, including lincRNAs. Taken together, these results argue that the large majority of lincRNAs do not function through encoded proteins.},

@article{Emerick2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:RNA metabolism, through 'combinatorial splicing', can generate enormous structural diversity in the proteome. Alternative domains may interact, however, with unpredictable phenotypic consequences, necessitating integrated RNA-level regulation of molecular composition. Splicing correlations within transcripts of single genes provide valuable clues to functional relationships among molecular domains as well as genomic targets for higher-order splicing regulation.RESULTS:We present tools to visualize complex splicing patterns in full-length cDNA libraries. Developmental changes in pair-wise correlations are presented vectorially in 'clock plots' and linkage grids. Higher-order correlations are assessed statistically through Monte Carlo analysis of a log-linear model with an empirical-Bayes estimate of the true probabilities of observed and unobserved splice forms. Log-linear coefficients are visualized in a 'spliceprint,' a signature of splice correlations in the transcriptome. We present two novel metrics: the linkage change index, which measures the directional change in pair-wise correlation with tissue differentiation, and the accuracy index, a very simple goodness-of-fit metric that is more sensitive than the integrated squared error when applied to sparsely populated tables, and unlike chi-square, does not diverge at low variance. Considerable attention is given to sparse contingency tables, which are inherent to single-gene libraries.CONCLUSION:Patterns of splicing correlations are revealed, which span a broad range of interaction order and change in development. The methods have a broad scope of applicability, beyond the single gene - including, for example, multiple gene interactions in the complete transcriptome.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have critical roles in the regulation of gene expression; however, as miRNA activity requires base pairing with only 6-8 nucleotides of messenger RNA, predicting target mRNAs is a major challenge. Recently, high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) has identified functional protein-RNA interaction sites. Here we use HITS-CLIP to covalently crosslink native argonaute (Ago, also called Eif2c) protein-RNA complexes in mouse brain. This produced two simultaneous data sets-Ago-miRNA and Ago-mRNA binding sites-that were combined with bioinformatic analysis to identify interaction sites between miRNA and target mRNA. We validated genome-wide interaction maps for miR-124, and generated additional maps for the 20 most abundant miRNAs present in P13 mouse brain. Ago HITS-CLIP provides a general platform for exploring the specificity and range of miRNA action in vivo, and identifies precise sequences for targeting clinically relevant miRNA-mRNA interactions.},

abstract = {In contrast to microRNAs and Piwi-associated RNAs, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are seemingly dispensable for host-directed gene regulation in Drosophila. This notion is based on the fact that mutants lacking the core siRNA-generating enzyme Dicer-2 or the predominant siRNA effector Argonaute 2 are viable, fertile and of relatively normal morphology1, 2. Moreover, endogenous Drosophila siRNAs have not yet been identified. Here we report that siRNAs derived from long hairpin RNA genes (hpRNAs) programme Slicer complexes that can repress endogenous target transcripts. The Drosophila hpRNA pathway is a hybrid mechanism that combines canonical RNA interference factors (Dicer-2, Hen1 (known as CG12367) and Argonaute 2) with a canonical microRNA factor (Loquacious) to generate 21-nucleotide siRNAs. These novel regulatory RNAs reveal unexpected complexity in the sorting of small RNAs, and open a window onto the biological usage of endogenous RNA interference in Drosophila.},

They play significant roles in constitutive pre-mRNA splicing and are also important regulators of alternative splicing. In addition they participate in post-splicing activities, such as mRNA nuclear export, nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and mRNA translation. These wide-ranging roles of SR proteins highlight their importance as pivotal regulators of mRNA metabolism, and if these functions are disrupted, developmental defects or disease may result. Furthermore, animal models have shown a highly specific, non-redundant role for individual SR proteins in the regulation of developmental processes. Here, we will review the current literature to demonstrate how SR proteins are emerging as one of the master regulators of gene expression.},

abstract = {Experimental introduction of RNA into cells can be used in certain biological systems to interfere with the function of an endogenous gene. Such effects have been proposed to result from a simple antisense mechanism that depends on hybridization between the injected RNA and endogenous messenger RNA transcripts. RNA interference has been used in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to manipulate gene expression. Here we investigate the requirements for structure and delivery of the interfering RNA. To our surprise, we found that double-stranded RNA was substantially more effective at producing interference than was either strand individually. After injection into adult animals, purified single strands had at most a modest effect, whereas double-stranded mixtures caused potent and specific interference. The effects of this interference were evident in both the injected animals and their progeny. Only a few molecules of injected double-stranded RNA were required per affected cell, arguing against stochiometric interference with endogenous mRNA and suggesting that there could be a catalytic or amplification component in the interference process.},

abstract = {The CpG island upstream of the GR is highly structured and conserved at least in all the animal species that have been investigated. Sequence alignment of these CpG islands shows inter-species homology ranging from 64 to 99\%. This 3.1kb CpG rich region upstream of the GR exon 2 encodes 5' untranslated mRNA regions. These CpG rich regions are organised into multiple first exons and, as we and others have postulated, each with its own promoter region. Alternative mRNA transcript variants are obtained by the splicing of these alternative first exons to a common acceptor site in the second exon of the GR. Exon 2 contains an in-frame stop codon immediately upstream of the ATG start codon to ensure that this 5' heterogeneity remains untranslated, and that the sequence and structure of the GR is unaffected. Tissue specific differential usage of exon 1s has been observed in a range of human tissues, and to a lesser extent in the rat and mouse. The GR expression level is tightly controlled within each tissue or cell type at baseline and upon stimulation. We suggest that no single promoter region may be capable of containing all the necessary promoter elements and yet preserve the necessary proximity to the transcription initiation site to produce such a plethora of responses. Thus we further suggest that alternative first exons each under the control of specific transcription factors control both the tissue specific GR expression and are involved in the tissue specific GR transcriptional response to stimulation. Spreading the necessary promoter elements over multiple promoter regions, each with an associated alternative transcription initiation site would appear to vastly increase the capacity for transcriptional control of GR.},

However, recent data have shown that these factors contact the RNA polymerase II as well as transcription factors and chromatin remodeling enzymes present inside the coding region of the gene. These observations favor a model where cotranscriptional splice decisions are assisted by factors recruited at the promoter or by the elongating polymerase. We also suggest that chromatin could function as an RNA-binding matrix displaying the immature transcripts to the spliceosomes.},

Sequencing small RNA fractions always identifies RNAs derived from abundant RNA species such as rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNA, and snoRNA, and they are widely considered to be random degradation products. We carried out bioinformatic analysis of deep sequenced HeLa RNA and after quality filtering, identified highly abundant small RNA fragments, derived from mature tRNAs that are likely produced by specific processing rather than from random degradation. Moreover, we showed that the processing of small RNAs derived from tRNAGln is dependent on Dicer in vivo and that Dicer cleaves the tRNA in vitro.},

abstract = {Drosophila Dscam isoforms are derived from two alternative transmembrane/juxtamembrane domains (TMs) in addition to thousands of ectodomain variants. Using a microRNA-based RNA interference technology, we selectively knocked down different subsets of Dscams containing either the exon 17.1- or exon 17.2-encoding TM. Eliminating Dscam[TM1] reduced Dscam expression but minimally affected postembryonic axonal morphogenesis. In contrast, depleting Dscam[TM2] blocked axon arborization. Further removal of Dscam[TM1] enhanced the loss-of-Dscam[TM2] axonal phenotypes. However, Dscam[TM1] primarily regulates dendritic development, as evidenced by the observations that removing Dscam[TM1] alone impeded elaboration of dendrites and that transgenic Dscam[TM1], but not Dscam[TM2], effectively rescued Dscam mutant dendritic phenotypes in mosaic organisms. These distinct Dscam functions can be attributed to the juxtamembrane regions of TMs that govern dendritic versus axonal targeting of Dscam as well. Together, we suggest that specific Drosophila Dscam juxtamembrane variants control dendritic elaboration and axonal arborization.},

abstract = {Piwi proteins and Piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs) have known functions in transposon silencing in the male germline of fetal and newborn mice. Both are also present in adult testes; however, their function here remains a mystery. Here, we confirm that most piRNAs in meiotic spermatocytes originate from clusters in non-repeat intergenic regions of DNA. The regulation of these piRNA clusters, including the processing of the precursor transcripts into individual piRNAs, is accomplished through mostly unknown processes. We present a possible regulatory mechanism for one such cluster, named cluster 1082B, located on chromosome 7 in the mouse genome. The 1082B precursor transcript and its 788 unique piRNAs are repressed by the Alkbh1 dioxygenase and the testis-specific transcription repressor Tzfp. We observe a remarkable >1000-fold upregulation of individual piRNAs in pachytene spermatocytes isolated from Alkbh1- and Tzfp-deficient murine testes. Repression of cluster 1082B is further supported by the identification of a 10-bp Tzfp recognition sequence contained within the precursor transcript. Downregulation of LINE1 and IAP transcripts in the Alkbh1- and Tzfp-deficient mice leads us to propose a potential role for the 1082B-encoded piRNAs in transposon control.},

abstract = {U1 snRNP (U1), in addition to its splicing role, protects pre-mRNAs from drastic premature termination by cleavage and polyadenylation (PCPA) at cryptic polyadenylation signals (PASs) in introns. Here, a high-throughput sequencing strategy of differentially expressed transcripts (HIDE-seq) mapped PCPA sites genome wide in divergent organisms. Surprisingly, whereas U1 depletion terminated most nascent gene transcripts within \~{}1 kb, moderate functional U1 level decreases, insufficient to inhibit splicing, dose-dependently shifted PCPA downstream and elicited mRNA 3' UTR shortening and proximal 3' exon switching characteristic of activated immune and neuronal cells, stem cells, and cancer. Activated neurons' signature mRNA shortening could be recapitulated by U1 decrease and antagonized by U1 overexpression. Importantly, we show that rapid and transient transcriptional upregulation inherent to neuronal activation physiology creates U1 shortage relative to pre-mRNAs. Additional experiments suggest cotranscriptional PCPA counteracted by U1 association with nascent transcripts, a process we term telescripting, ensuring transcriptome integrity and regulating mRNA length.},

The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r2 of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30\% of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1\% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the strength or efficacy of natural selection between populations.},

abstract = {Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be generated from somatic cells by the introduction of Oct3/4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, in mouse and in human. The efficiency of this process, however, is low. Pluripotency can be induced without c-Myc, but with even lower efficiency. A p53 (also known as TP53 in humans and Trp53 in mice) short-interfering RNA (siRNA) was recently shown to promote human iPS cell generation, but the specificity and mechanisms remain to be determined. Here we report that up to 10\% of transduced mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53 became iPS cells, even without the Myc retrovirus. The p53 deletion also promoted the induction of integration-free mouse iPS cells with plasmid transfection. Furthermore, in the p53-null background, iPS cells were generated from terminally differentiated T lymphocytes. The suppression of p53 also increased the efficiency of human iPS cell generation. DNA microarray analyses identified 34 p53-regulated genes that are common in mouse and human fibroblasts. Functional analyses of these genes demonstrate that the p53-p21 pathway serves as a barrier not only in tumorigenicity, but also in iPS cell generation.},

abstract = {The nucleolus is a distinct subnuclear compartment that was first observed more than 200 years ago. Nucleoli assemble around the tandemly repeated ribosomal DNA gene clusters and 28S, 18S and 5.8S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are transcribed as a single precursor, which is processed and assembled with the 5S rRNA into ribosome subunits. Although the nucleolus is primarily associated with ribosome biogenesis, several lines of evidence now show that it has additional functions. Some of these functions, such as regulation of mitosis, cell-cycle progression and proliferation, many forms of stress response and biogenesis of multiple ribonucleoprotein particles, will be discussed, as will the relation of the nucleolus to human diseases.},

abstract = {To elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying dioecious flower development, the present study analyzed a SUPERMAN (SUP) homolog, SlSUP, which was identified in Silene latifolia. The sex of this plant is determined by heteromorphic X and Y sex chromosomes. It was revealed that SlSUP is a single-copy autosomal gene expressed exclusively in female flowers. Introduction of a genomic copy of SlSUP into the Arabidopsis thaliana sup (sup-2) mutant complemented the excess-stamen and infertile phenotypes of sup-2, and the overexpression of SlSUP in transgenic Arabidopsis plants resulted in reduced stamen numbers as well as the suppression of petal elongation. During the development of the female flower in S. latifolia, the expression of SlSUP is first detectable in whorls 2 and 3 when the normal expression pattern of the B-class flowering genes was already established and persisted in the stamen primordia until the ovule had matured completely. In addition, significant expression of SlSUP was detected in the ovules, suggestive of the involvement of this gene in ovule development. Furthermore, it was revealed that the de-suppression of stamen development by infection of the S. latifolia female flower with Microbotryum violaceum was accompanied by a significant reduction in SlSUP transcript levels in the induced organs. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SlSUP is a female flower-specific gene and suggest that SlSUP has a positive role in the female flower developmental pathways of S. latifolia.},

It is attained by several underlying principles that are universal to both biological organisms and sophisticated engineering systems. Robustness facilitates evolvability and robust traits are often selected by evolution. Such a mutually beneficial process is made possible by specific architectural features observed in robust systems. But there are trade-offs between robustness, fragility, performance and resource demands, which explain system behaviour, including the patterns of failure. Insights into inherent properties of robust systems will provide us with a better understanding of complex diseases and a guiding principle for therapy design.},

Few indeed are the philosophers or historians influential enough to make it into the funny papers, but Kuhn is one. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is indeed a paradigmatic work in the history of science. Kuhn's use of terms such as "paradigm shift" and "normal science," his ideas of how scientists move from disdain through doubt to acceptance of a new theory, his stress on social and psychological factors in science-all have had profound effects on historians, scientists, philosophers, critics, writers, business gurus, and even the cartoonist in the street. Some scientists (such as Steven Weinberg and Ernst Mayr) are profoundly irritated by Kuhn, especially by the doubts he casts-or the way his work has been used to cast doubt-on the idea of scientific progress. Yet it has been said that the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s, for instance, was sped by geologists' reluctance to be on the downside of a paradigm shift. Even Weinberg has said that "Structure has had a wider influence than any other book on the history of science." As one of Kuhn's obituaries noted, "We all live in a post-Kuhnian age." -Mary Ellen Curtin},

abstract = {Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27\% of them, or 48\% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre—layout (or conventional) and layout—specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

This suggests that males and females of M. annua differentially modify the soil in which they are growing.

abstract = {In many ways, plants offer unique systems through which to study sex determination. Because the production of unisexual flowers has evolved independently in many plant species, different and novel mechanisms may be operational. Hence, there is probably not one unifying mechanism that explains sex determination in plants. Advances in our understanding of sex determination will come from the analysis of the genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry of genes controlling sexual determination in plants. Several excellent model systems for bisexual floral development (Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum), monoecy (maize), and dioecy (Silene, asparagus, and mercury) are available for such analyses. The important questions that remain concern the mechanism of action of sex determination genes and their interrelationship, if any, with homeotic genes that determine the sexual identity of floral organ primordia. At the physiological level, the connection between hormone signaling and sexuality is not well understood, although significant correlations have been discovered. Finally, once the genes that regulate these processes are identified, cloned, and studied, new strategies for the manipulation of sexuality in plants should be forthcoming.},

abstract = {The term apoptosis is proposed for a hitherto little recognized mechanism of controlled cell deletion, which appears to play a complementary but opposite role to mitosis in the regulation of animal cell populations. Its morphological features suggest that it is an active, inherently programmed phenomenon, and it has been shown that it can be initiated or inhibited by a variety of environmental stimuli, both physiological and pathological. The structural changes take place in two discrete stages. The first comprises nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation and breaking up of the cell into a number of membrane-bound, ultrastructurally well-preserved fragments. In the second stage these apoptotic bodies are shed from epithelial-lined surfaces or are taken up by other cells, where they undergo a series of changes resembling in vitro autolysis within phagosomes, and are rapidly degraded by lysosomal enzymes derived from the ingesting cells. Apoptosis seems to be involved in cell turnover in many healthy adult tissues and is responsible for focal elimination of cells during normal embryonic development. It occurs spontaneously in untreated malignant neoplasms, and participates in at least some types of therapeutically induced tumour regression. It is implicated in both physiological involution and atrophy of various tissues and organs. It can also be triggered by noxious agents, both in the embryo and adult animal.

abstract = {This article explores the influences of light on human health and suggests that exposure to artificial light may have harmful effects. The effects of ligght on mammalian tissue are either direct or indirect, depending on whether the immediate cause is a photochemical reaction within the tissue or a neural or neuroendocrine signal generated by a photoreceptor cell. Light exerts an indirect effect on the ovaries of rats and this effect is mediated by photoceptive cells in the retina. The light cycles involved in night and day and changing day lenght appear to be associated with rhythmic changes in mammalian biological functions such as body temperature. Light levels and rhythms also influence the maturation and subsequent cyclic activity in the gonads of mammals, with the particular response seemingly dependent on whether the species ovulated once a year or at regular intervals. Ovulation can be accelerated in diurnally active, monestrous animals by exposing them to artificially long days. Pineal activity in rats can be suppressed by exposing the animals continuously to light. Such findings on the multiple and disparate effects of light suggest the view that health considerations should be incorporated into the design of light environments. The illumination provided by artificial indoor lighting is often less than 10\% of the light normally available outdoors. It is urged that decisions on lighting be based on knowledge of man's biological needs as well as economic and technoloical considerations},

Its unfoldings have kept me enthralled ever since. We began with bacteria -- and especially with bacteriophage lambda (\{lambda\}) -- and then moved to work with yeast and mammalian cells. We always sought coherent descriptions, ideas that would apply to apparently disparate cases -- regulation of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes, for example, despite the fact that the latter, but not the former, are sequestered in a nucleus and wrapped in nucleosomes. My goal here is to put the various stages of our understanding, from the beginning of my involvement, in an overarching context. I might not say anything that has not been said by others or me, but my hope is that otherwise obscure connections and simplifications will be made clear. I hope I avoid distortions, but I cannot cite all the important contributions of others. More detailed explanations for various experiments and arguments, along with more extensive references, can be found in my two books and in the references here (1, 2).

Its general object is to discuss the results of the preceding papers (Part I), to put them into mathematical form (Part II) and to show that they will account for conduction and excitation in quantitative terms (Part III).},
annote = {This paper is the last in a series of classic experiments by Hodgkin and Huxley to determine the ionic basis of action potential generation and conduction in nerve fibers, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1963. It provides a synthesis of the preceding papers through a quantitative description of the various conductances that contribute to the action potential. This description was notable not only for its accuracy (the Hodgkin and Huxley equations are still used in most computer simulations of neurons to this day) but because it was able to precicely predict structural properties of ion channels that were not previously known. The paper thus serves as a model for what all physiological investigations should aspire to do. },

abstract = {Investigations of long-term changes in brain structure and function that accompany chronic exposure to drugs of abuse suggest that alterations in gene regulation contribute substantially to the addictive phenotype. Here, we review multiple mechanisms by which drugs alter the transcriptional potential of genes. These mechanisms range from the mobilization or repression of the transcriptional machinery - including the transcription factors $\Delta$FOSB, cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) - to epigenetics - including alterations in the accessibility of genes within their native chromatin structure induced by histone tail modifications and DNA methylation, and the regulation of gene expression by non-coding RNAs. Increasing evidence implicates these various mechanisms of gene regulation in the lasting changes that drugs of abuse induce in the brain, and offers novel inroads for addiction therapy.},

@misc{Parvathy2002a,
abstract = {DNA dodecamers have been designed with two cytosines on each end and intervening A and T stretches, such that the oligomers have fully complementary A:T base pairs when aligned in the parallel orientation. Spectroscopic (UV, CD and IR), NMR and molecular dynamics studies have shown that oligomers having the sequences d(CCATAATTTACC) and d(CCTATTAAATCC) form a parallel-stranded duplex when dissolved at 1:1 stoichiometry in aqueous solution. This is due to the C:C+ clamps on either end and extensive mismatches in the antiparallel orientation. The structure is stable at neutral and acidic pH. At higher temperatures, the duplex melts into single strands in a highly cooperative fashion. All adenine, cytosine and thymine nucleotides adopt the anti conformation with respect to the glycosidic bond. The A:T base pairs form reverse Watson-Crick base pairs. The duplex shows base stacking and NOEs between the base protons T(H6)/A(H8) and the sugar protons (H1'/H2'/H2") of the preceding nucleotide, as has been observed in antiparallel duplexes. However, no NOEs are observed between base protons H2/H6/H8 of sequential nucleotides, though such NOEs are observed between T(CH3) and A(H8). A three-dimensional structure of the parallel-stranded duplex at atomic resolution has been obtained using molecular dynamics simulations under NMR constraints. The simulated structures have torsional angles very similar to those found in B-DNA duplexes, but the base stacking and helicoid parameters are significantly different.},

Thus the high proliferative potential of bone marrow FCFC and their ability to serve as common precursors of bone and cartilage-forming cells makes them probable candidates for the role of osteogenic stem cells.},

abstract = {Biogeography was stuck in a "natural history phase" dominated by the collection of data, the young Princeton biologists Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson argued in 1967. In this book, the authors developed a general theory to explain the facts of island biogeography. The theory builds on the first principles of population ecology and genetics to explain how distance and area combine to regulate the balance between immigration and extinction in island populations. The authors then test the theory against data.The Theory of Island Biogeography was never intended as the last word on the subject. Instead, MacArthur and Wilson sought to stimulate new forms of theoretical and empirical studies, which will lead in turn to a stronger general theory. Even a third of a century since its publication, the book continues to serve that purpose well. From popular books like David Quammen's Song of the Dodo to arguments in the professional literature, The Theory of Island Biogeography remains at the center of discussions about the geographic distribution of species. In a new preface, Edward O. Wilson reviews the origins and consequences of this classic book.},

Genetic and molecular definition of these three immune hallmarks of cancer offers the opportunity to learn how to deploy specific countermeasures to reverse the situation in favor of the immune system and, eventually, the patient. This new information could be channeled to address what seem to be the three major hallmarks for the immune control of cancer progression: effective procedures to activate immune reactivity; characterization of not-disposable oncoantigens; and counteraction of immune suppression.},

We describe Y chromosome deletion mutants of Silene latifolia, a dioecious plant with heteromorphic sex chromosomes. The combination of results from new and previously described deletions with histological descriptions of their stamen development defects indicates the presence of two distinct Y regions containing loci with indispensable roles in male reproduction. We determined their positions relative to the two main sex determination functions (female suppressing and the other male promoting). A region proximal to the centromere on the Y p arm containing the putative stamen promoting sex determination locus includes additional early stamen developmental factors. A medial region of the Y q arm carries late pollen fertility factors. Cytological analysis of meiotic X-Y pairing in one of the male-sterile mutants indicates that the Y carries sequences or functions specifically affecting sex chromosome pairing.},

Advances in high-throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation and suggest the potential to use large samples to uncover variation among closely spaced populations. Here we characterize genetic variation in a sample of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable DNA sites in the human genome. Despite low average levels of genetic differentiation among Europeans, we find a close correspondence between genetic and geographic distances; indeed, a geographical map of Europe arises naturally as an efficient two-dimensional summary of genetic variation in Europeans. The results emphasize that when mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition, the results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing; an individual's DNA can be used to infer their geographic origin with surprising accuracy-often to within a few hundred kilometres.},

abstract = {Several lists of grand challenges in biology have been published recently, highlighting the strong need to answer fundamental questions about how life evolves and is governed, and how to apply this knowledge to solve the pressing problems of our times. To succeed in addressing the challenges of 21st century biology, scientists need to generate, have access to, interpret, and archive more information than ever before. But for many important questions in biology, progress is stymied by a lack of essential tools. Discovering and developing necessary tools requires new technolo- gies, applications of existing technologies, software, model organisms, and social structures. Such new social structures will promote tool building, tool sharing, research collaboration, and interdisciplinary training. Here we identify examples of the some of the most important needs for addressing critical questions in biology and making important advances in the near future.},

We are witnessing a powerful resurgence of this idea made possible by the availability of nearly complete genome sequences, ever improving gene annotations and interactome network maps, the development of sophisticated informatic and imaging tools, and importantly, the use of engineering and physics concepts such as control and graph theory. Alongside four other fundamental "great ideas" as suggested by Sir Paul Nurse, namely, the gene, the cell, the role of chemistry in biological processes, and evolution by natural selection, systems-level understanding of "What is Life" may materialize as one of the major ideas of biology.},

abstract = {Inositol phospholipids play multiple roles in cell signalling systems. Two widespread eukaryotic phosphoinositide-based signal transduction mechanisms, phosphoinositidase C-catalysed phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) hydrolysis and 3-OH kinase-catalysed PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphorylation, make the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) sn-1,2-diacylglycerol and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In addition, PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns3P have been implicated in exocytosis and membrane trafficking. We now show that when the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe are hyperosmotically stressed, they rapidly synthesize phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) by a process that involves activation of a PtdIns3P 5-OH kinase. This PtdIns(3,5)P2 accumulation only occurs in yeasts that have an active vps34-encoded PtdIns 3-OH kinase, showing that this latter kinase makes the PtdIns3P needed for PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis and indicating that PtdIns(3,5)P2 may have a role in sorting vesicular proteins. PtdIns(3,5)P2 is also present in mammalian and plant cells: in monkey Cos-7 cells, its labelling is inversely related to the external osmotic pressure. The stimulation of a PtdIns3P 5-OH kinase-catalysed synthesis of PtdIns(3,5)P2, a molecule that might be a new type of phosphoinositide 'second messenger, thus appears to be central to a widespread and previously uncharacterized regulatory pathway.},

abstract = {The generation of second messengers from the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) by phosphoinositidase C has been implicated in the mediation of cellular responses to a variety of growth factors and oncogene products. The first step in the production of PtdInsP2 from phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) is catalysed by PtdIns kinase. A PtdIns kinase activity has been found to associate specifically with several oncogene products, as well as with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor. We have previously identified two biochemically distinct PtdIns kinases in fibroblasts, and have found that only one of these, designated type I, specifically associates with activated tyrosine kinases. We have now characterized the site on the inositol ring phosphorylated by type I PtdIns kinase, and find that this kinase specifically phosphorylates the D-3 ring position to generate a novel phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). In contrast, the main PtdIns kinase in fibroblasts, designated type II, specifically phosphorylates the D-4 position to produce phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), previously considered to be the only form of PtdInsP. We have also tentatively identified PtdIns(3)P as a minor component of total PtdInsP in intact fibroblasts. We propose that type I PtdIns kinase is responsible for the generation of PtdIns(3)P in intact cells, and that this novel phosphoinositide could be important in the transduction of mitogenic and oncogenic signals.},

@article{Birch1948,
annote = {This was the first application of the statistic known as the intrinsic rate of natural increase to an insect population (the weevil Calandra oryzae). It was calculated from experimental data on the age schedule of births and deaths in controlled environments. The study was conducted under the objective of determining the most favorable environments for the storage of grain stockpiled in Australia during the World War II, and hence finding the environments less favorable for the multiplication of the insect pests of stored grain.
        
The measure was based on the demographic parameter developed by Lotka (Elements of physical biology, 1925) for human populations, and developed a few years after the first determination of the intrinsic rate of increase of an animal other than man made by Leslie \& Ranson (The mortality, fertility and rate of natural increase of the vole (Microtus agrestis) as observed in the laboratory, 1940) for the vole Microtus agrestis from age-specific rates of fecundity and mortality determined under laboratory conditions.
        
Birch defined the "intrinsic rate of natural increase" as "the rate of increase per head under specified physical conditions, in an unlimited environment where the effects of increasing density do not need to be considered". The growth of such a population is by definition exponential. This parameter is the "r" in the differential equation for population increase: dN/dt=rN, that is, the difference between the birth-rate and the death-rate in the population. It does not describe the actual rate of increase of a population at a particular point of time but the maximum rate that it can ever maintain over an indefinite period of time "in a population with a stable age distribution". 
        
The method used in the calculations provided a means of determining the extent to which various components enter into the value of the intrinsic rate of natural increase: 1) the life table: the probability at birth of being alive at age x; 2) the fecundity table: the mean number of female offspring produced in a unit of time by a female aged x; and 3) the length of the pre-reproductive stages. One of the results was that the intrinsic rate of natural increase of C. oryzae was determined to a much greater extent by the rate of egg-laying in the first two weeks of life than by the total number of eggs laid in the entire life of 30 weeks.},

abstract = {Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has been accomplished by expressing pluripotency factors and oncogenes, but the low frequency and tendency to induce malignant transformation compromise the clinical utility of this powerful approach. We address both issues by investigating the mechanisms limiting reprogramming efficiency in somatic cells. Here we show that reprogramming factors can activate the p53 (also known as Trp53 in mice, TP53 in humans) pathway. Reducing signalling to p53 by expressing a mutated version of one of its negative regulators, by deleting or knocking down p53 or its target gene, p21 (also known as Cdkn1a), or by antagonizing reprogramming-induced apoptosis in mouse fibroblasts increases reprogramming efficiency. Notably, decreasing p53 protein levels enabled fibroblasts to give rise to iPS cells capable of generating germline-transmitting chimaeric mice using only Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) and Sox2. Furthermore, silencing of p53 significantly increased the reprogramming efficiency of human somatic cells. These results provide insights into reprogramming mechanisms and suggest new routes to more efficient reprogramming while minimizing the use of oncogenes.},

@article{Gerrodette2011,
abstract = {Despite more than half a century of criticism, significance testing continues to be used commonly by ecologists. Significance tests are widely misused and misunderstood, and even when properly used, they are not very informative for most ecological data. Problems of misuse and misinterpretation include: (i) invalid logic; (ii) rote use; (iii) equating statistical significance with biological importance; (iv) regarding the P-value as the probability that the null hypothesis is true; (v) regarding the P-value as a measure of effect size; and (vi) regarding the P-value as a measure of evidence. Significance tests are poorly suited for inference because they pose the wrong question. In addition, most null hypotheses in ecology are point hypotheses already known to be false, so whether they are rejected or not provides little additional understanding. Ecological data rarely fit the controlled experimental setting for which significance tests were developed. More satisfactory methods of inference assess the degree of support which data provide for hypotheses, measured in terms of information theory (model-based inference), likelihood ratios (likelihood inference) or probability (Bayesian inference). Modern statistical methods allow multiple data sets to be combined into a single likelihood framework, avoiding the loss of information that can occur when data are analyzed in separate steps. Inference based on significance testing is compared with model-based, likelihood and Bayesian inference using data on an endangered porpoise, Phocoena sinus. All of the alternatives lead to greater understanding and improved inference than provided by a P-value and the associated statement of statistical significance.},

@book{Dawkins1976,
abstract = {Inheriting the mantle of revolutionary biologist from Darwin, Watson, and Crick, Richard Dawkins forced an enormous change in the way we see ourselves and the world with the publication of The Selfish Gene. Suppose, instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves, as we had since Mendel's work was rediscovered, we turn it around and imagine that "our" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years, and we haven't thought of evolution in the same way since. Why are there miles and miles of "unused" DNA within each of our bodies? Why should a bee give up its own chance to reproduce to help raise her sisters and brothers? With a prophet's clarity, Dawkins told us the answers from the perspective of molecules competing for limited space and resources to produce more of their own kind. Drawing fascinating examples from every field of biology, he paved the way for a serious re-evaluation of evolution. He also introduced the concept of self-reproducing ideas, or memes, which (seemingly) use humans exclusively for their propagation. If we are puppets, he says, at least we can try to understand our strings. -Rob Lightner Richard Dawkins' brilliant reformulation of the theory of natural selection has the rare distinction of having provoked as much excitement and interest outside the scientific community as within it. His theories have helped change the whole nature of the study of social biology, and have forced thousands of readers to rethink their beliefs about life. In his internationally bestselling, now classic volume, The Selfish Gene, Dawkins explains how the selfish gene can also be a subtle gene. The world of the selfish gene revolves around savage competition, ruthless exploitation, and deceit, and yet, Dawkins argues, acts of apparent altruism do exist in nature. Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk. This revised edition of Dawkins' fascinating book contains two new chapters. One, entitled "Nice Guys Finish First," demonstrates how cooperation can evolve even in a basically selfish world. The other new chapter, entitled "The Long Reach of the Gene," which reflects the arguments presented in Dawkins' The Extended Phenotype, clarifies the startling view that genes may reach outside the bodies in which they dwell and manipulate other individuals and even the world at large. Containing a wealth of remarkable new insights into the biological world, the second edition once again drives home the fact that truth is stranger than fiction.},

Arguing for a material, not divine, origin of species, he showed that new species are achieved by `natural selection'. Development, diversification, decay, extinction, and absence ofplan are all inherent to his theories. Darwin read prodigiously across many fields; he reflected on his experiences as a traveller; he experimented. His profoundly influential concept of `natural selection' condenses materials from past and present, from the Galapagos Islands to rural Staffordshire, from English back gardens tocolonial encounters. The Origin communicates the enthusiasm of original thinking in an open, descriptive style, and Darwin's emphasis on the value of diversity speaks more strongly now than ever. As well as a stimulating introduction and notes, this edition offers a register of the many writers referred to by Darwin in the text.},

@article{Everitt2005,
abstract = {Drug addiction is increasingly viewed as the endpoint of a series of transitions from initial drug use--when a drug is voluntarily taken because it has reinforcing, often hedonic, effects--through loss of control over this behavior, such that it becomes habitual and ultimately compulsive. Here we discuss evidence that these transitions depend on interactions between pavlovian and instrumental learning processes. We hypothesize that the change from voluntary drug use to more habitual and compulsive drug use represents a transition at the neural level from prefrontal cortical to striatal control over drug seeking and drug taking behavior as well as a progression from ventral to more dorsal domains of the striatum, involving its dopaminergic innervation. These neural transitions may themselves depend on the neuroplasticity in both cortical and striatal structures that is induced by chronic self-administration of drugs.},

abstract = {With the discovery in the late 1980s that the DNA-repair gene RAD6 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, it became clear that protein modification by ubiquitin conjugation has a much broader significance than had previously been assumed. Now, two decades later, ubiquitin and its cousin SUMO are implicated in a range of human diseases, including breast cancer and Fanconi anaemia, giving fresh momentum to studies focused on the relationships between ubiquitin, SUMO and DNA-repair pathways.},

@article{Hollwich1980,
abstract = {Color change of the plaice and frog, and development of the testes in duck are induced by light stimuli via the eye. Eliminating experiences on the frog (Hollwich) and on the duck (Benoit) showed that these stimuli – beside vision – use a separate way, the so-called ‘energetic portion’ of the visual pathway (Hollwich). In compared studies on blind and on temporarily blind patients involved by cataract in both eyes, we found significant low levels of ACTH and cortisol. The levels normalized after cataract extraction. – Furthermore, we studied the influence of strong artificial illumination (3,500 and 3,200 lx) on healthy persons with considerable and, on the other hand, with minimal difference of their spectral composition to daylight. We found stress-like levels of ACTH and cortisol in the first group. These findings explain the agitated mental and physical behavior of children staying the whole day in school under artificial illumination with strong spectral deviation from daylight. Therefore, to avoid mental and physical alterations, the spectrum of artificial illumination should be largely similar to that of natural light.},

@article{Taylor2009a,
abstract = {Changes in the biochemical wiring of oncogenic cells drives phenotypic transformations that directly affect disease outcome. Here we examine the dynamic structure of the human protein interaction network (interactome) to determine whether changes in the organization of the interactome can be used to predict patient outcome. An analysis of hub proteins identified intermodular hub proteins that are co-expressed with their interacting partners in a tissue-restricted manner and intramodular hub proteins that are co-expressed with their interacting partners in all or most tissues. Substantial differences in biochemical structure were observed between the two types of hubs. Signaling domains were found more often in intermodular hub proteins, which were also more frequently associated with oncogenesis. Analysis of two breast cancer patient cohorts revealed that altered modularity of the human interactome may be useful as an indicator of breast cancer prognosis.},

@article{Ming2011,
abstract = {Sex chromosomes in land plants can evolve as a consequence of close linkage between the two sex determination genes with complementary dominance required to establish stable dioecious populations, and they are found in at least 48 species across 20 families. The sex chromosomes in hepatics, mosses, and gymnosperms are morphologically heteromorphic. In angiosperms, heteromorphic sex chromosomes are found in at least 19 species from 4 families, while homomorphic sex chromosomes occur in 20 species from 13 families. The prevalence of the XY system found in 44 out of 48 species may reflect the predominance of the evolutionary pathway from gynodioecy towards dioecy. All dioecious species have the potential to evolve sex chromosomes, and reversions back from dioecy to various forms of monoecy, gynodioecy, or androdioecy have also occurred. Such reversals may occur especially during the early stages of sex chromosome evolution before the lethality of the YY (or WW) genotype is established.},
